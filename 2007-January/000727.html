<PRE>Actually, I found it pretty easy to get MIDI working. Getting a software
synthesizer to run was a bit tricky, but no black magic. The problem
with shipping MIDI is that the music will sound totally different on
every machine. The music files I'm currently producing are not in the
General MIDI range, so I'd have to rewrite almost every song. Also, I'm
rendering them on a thousand-dollar tone generator - I sincerely hope
that there is no way of getting the same quality for free. :-)
Anyway, I think that from an artist's point of view, not having the
slightest idea of what your work will sound like on the players'
computers is not acceptable, especially when it's just for saving a few
megabytes. I remember playing old games that came with MIDI files
because they had to fit on a few floppy disks (for example, old
LucasArts adventures). I used to complain about how crappy the music was
because I had a crappy sound card. Rendering the same MIDI files on
modern hardware makes me feel sympathy for the composers, because only a
small percentage of the audience really got an idea of what the songs
were intended to sound like: Namely, other musicians who used the same
hardware. I discovered that tunes that sounded like cheap background
music on a SoundBlaster16 were actually works of high composing skill. I
still have a long way to go before I can write music like they can, but
I think we should make use of the ways we have now to make the music
sound as good as possible. I agree that the tarball is pretty big, but
file size isn't that much of a problem anymore. Especially people who
play games are used to much bigger downloads.

As for reducing the quality: I currently compress the songs to 160kb
Ogg, and even with that relatively high quality rate, the difference to
the uncompressed originals is clearly audible (which really surprised
me). Especially in the high-frequency range, such as the piano part on
bossattack.ogg. I'll still have to try using stronger compression but
I'm sure I won't like the results. Maybe that's just because I've heard
them uncompressed, and because I know every single note of every song -
so maybe I'm not the one who should judge over whether the quality is
sufficient. I'll also try fiddling with my recording chain to squeeze a
little more quality out of it at the same compression rate. And I guess
I could go down to 128kb if size really matters to you. :-) But I
wouldn't like to go below that.

As for the sound track CD that is supposed to be released with Milestone
2, I'm planning to make it available as a disc image containing the
uncompressed music. I wonder how that will affect the decision on the
in-game quality. Will people notice the difference? And if they do, will
they care? And if they care, will they bother to compress the tracks
themselves and replace the ones we shipped? Or will they want to know
why we didn't do so ourselves?

Sorry for the long rant. But I think that the loss of quality that comes
with stronger compression doesn't justify the few megabytes we'd save.
