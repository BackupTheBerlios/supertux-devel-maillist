Hello Marek!

You found me! Actually, I was never approached about including the
song in question i later found out about it via a random googlesession.
I tried to get in contact but no success or answers on mail. I am more
flattered than upset :).

I once way back in time downloaded a  mac version but my skills in
gameplay are really weak and i didn't get very far in the game.

okay.

Soundtrack:

I am a big friend of CC-BY-SA and have no problem with the song being  
included
on the OST.

the game:
&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;
since i prior to this mail havent yet granted anything about  
mortimers chipdisko in
anything i will do it here.

&quot;I hereby grant you to use the song &quot;mortimer's chipdisko&quot; in the  
game supertux under the
GNU general public licence. Please credit lukas nystrand as mortimer  
twang as
composer/author of the song.&quot;

Lukas Nystrand, Landsbro Sweden. 15th of januari 2007.

Kind regards.
Lukas Nystrand.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> I'm writing you because I'm looking for the author of a tune called
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Mortimer's Chipdisko&quot;. As you probably know, that song is part of the
</I>&gt;<i> soundtrack of an open source game called SuperTux. I am part of the
</I>&gt;<i> SuperTux development team, and responsible for the game music.  
</I>&gt;<i> Chipdisko
</I>&gt;<i> was already in the game before I joined the team, so I assume that you
</I>&gt;<i> already granted your permission to publish the song with the game  
</I>&gt;<i> under
</I>&gt;<i> the General Public License. However, some Linux distributors require
</I>&gt;<i> clearance regarding the license of some of the files included in
</I>&gt;<i> SuperTux; your song is one of the files in question.
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, I'm currently working on a SuperTux soundtrack album  
</I>&gt;<i> to be
</I>&gt;<i> released with the next version of the game. I'd like to include
</I>&gt;<i> Chipdisko on that album, which should be released under a Creative
</I>&gt;<i> Commons license, preferrably CC-BY-SA. I'm planning to offer this  
</I>&gt;<i> album
</I>&gt;<i> for free download on the web, as well as submitting it to last.fm
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.last.fm">http://www.last.fm</A>), a web radio service promoting and streaming free
</I>&gt;<i> music.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since Mortimer's Chipdisko is often voted by SuperTux fans as their
</I>&gt;<i> favourite song from the game, I would be happy if you gave us  
</I>&gt;<i> permission
</I>&gt;<i> to include the song on the soundtrack album and renewed your  
</I>&gt;<i> permission
</I>&gt;<i> (that you hopefully already gave) to release the song under the GPL as
</I>&gt;<i> part of the game.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you very much for your help, and keep up the good work!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Marek &quot;Wansti&quot; M&#246;ckel
</I>&gt;<i> SuperTux Development Team
