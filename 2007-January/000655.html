<PRE>Couldn't we simply tell them that Debian is a broken distro? If they do that
then we can tell them that we are not going to support any user that use Debian
and comes to us and ask for any problem at all.

Another thing that seems bad in that link is:
&gt;<i> Unfortunately, there's a problem with this version: it contains music &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> sound effects that are not DFSG-free. I'll have a look at trying to
</I>&gt;<i> delete some of them in a week (once I'm back on a sid box, with X
</I>&gt;<i> enable, I'm working over ssh at the moment, and a better box than my
</I>&gt;<i> iBook :p).
</I>
I hope they don't delete our sound and music, if that is the case, I would
suggest we are not going to support Debian either as the music is important to
the &quot;SuperTux experience&quot;.
