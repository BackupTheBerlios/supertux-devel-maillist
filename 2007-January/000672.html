If you got a soundcard that has hardware support for MIDI it works well under
Linux. Far from all people have that.

And timidity has always been problematic for me. On my old computer (a Pentium
4) timidity lagged so much it was impossible to guess what the music originally
sounded like. Even if you weren't doing anything else at the same time.

On my current one (an AMD64) it is worse: timidity freezes X.Org totally. I have
to ssh in to kill it, I can't even switch to a virtual terminal...

Note that if I use the hardware MIDI that I in fact got on my sound card
(SoundBlaster Live! 5.1) MIDI works great, but I have seen very few cards that
have hardware midi, and no onboard sound with it at all...
