I don't think we should we worrying about the file size too much. Does
20MB compared to 35MB really make that much of a difference? I don't
think so. How hard can it be to get 35MB off the internet? There are
fast connections everywhere, there's internet cafes, CD-ROM's, USB
sticks, flash cards... If downloading 35 megabytes is a problem for
someone, so is downloading twenty. If the only choice we had was between
fully compressed and uncompressed (i.e. 20MB versus 450MB), that would
be a different matter. But 15MB just isn't worth it, IMHO. I'll upload
128kb versions of the songs later today if you want me to.
Distributors always have the option to put the music into a different
package for people who don't want it.

Whether it looks or sounds &quot;good enough&quot; is not the only thing that
matters, IMHO. I think we should try to get the maximum quality out of
the artwork and music that is possible without making it too expensive
on the other end. Like I said, the difference between uncompressed and
160kb isn't worth 400MB, but the difference between &quot;-q 1&quot; and &quot;-q 6&quot;
(or 5) is worth a few bytes.
