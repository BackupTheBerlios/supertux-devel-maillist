</I>We should wait for Christoph to chime in; he's a SuperTux dev and he's
made the NoGL patch mentioned in that post. We can just point people in
his direction in case something is bungled with the Debian version (if
he chooses to support it) or send people to hell^H^H^H^H^H the
autopackage (if he doesn't).

Additionally: no, I'm pretty sure performance will suck more with Mesa
than with the NoGL patch. The SDL-only version does everything in 2D,
keeping the performance around ST 0.1.x levels. Mesa -- believe me, I
tried back then on Linux with 2.4GHz -- makes the whole thing a slide
show, since it's doing 3D stuff for a 2D game on a CPU. Remember the
README: OpenGL and Mesa? 10GHz processor, please. Or buy yourself a
GeForce FX5200 or 6200 for a bargain bin price.

As for the non-free music... that Brulebois guy says he's gonna be
removing it from the package ASAP. He's probably had it lying around to
make his copy of SuperTux a bit more different and didn't know he can do
so in ~/.supertux/music without disrupting ./data/music. (Yes, I openly
admit that I had Rammstein's &quot;Sonne&quot; as ~/.supertux/music/theme.ogg. It
was only a test. Honestly. ;-))
&gt;<i> Does anybody here know the debian packagers? Do we want to
</I>&gt;<i> ask them about it? Or just wait what they really do and recommend the
</I>&gt;<i> autopackage to everyone with poor performance?

P.S. Yes, that means &quot;Goodbye&quot; in Czech. Yes, it is a prod at Wolfgang.
Don't take it the wrong way. ;-)
