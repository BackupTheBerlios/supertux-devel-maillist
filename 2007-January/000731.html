The important part isn't if they will notice the difference, but
simply if the music will sound fine with a higher compression setting.
I mean I could complain all day how a PNG looks superior over a JPEG,
but at the end of the day the only thing that matters is that the JPEG
looks 'good enough', it doesn't need to be perfect, not even close to
it and neither need the music.

Ogg at 160kbs is really over the top, given that most people can't
even tell the difference between CD and 128kbs MP3 given a good audio
setup. Ogg is even better then Mp3 and most PCs audio setup are simply
crap, so I have some doubt that anybody would ever notice, especially
when they don't compare the songs side by side.

Just for the record, 35MB is huge, some people are still on modem or
isdn and downloading that there takes quite a while. I kind of
consider 10MB the target size, I don't expect SuperTux to ever reach
that again, but we should at least try to get a little bit closer then
we are now.
