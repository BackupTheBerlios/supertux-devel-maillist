<PRE>Like I said, we're using Ogg, and it sounds awesome no matter how low you
crank the bitrate. I'm trying to find the sweetspot right now, but Oggs are
notorious for sounding clear.

</I>&gt;<i> Actually, I found it pretty easy to get MIDI working. Getting a software
</I>&gt;<i> synthesizer to run was a bit tricky, but no black magic. The problem
</I>&gt;<i> with shipping MIDI is that the music will sound totally different on
</I>&gt;<i> every machine. The music files I'm currently producing are not in the
</I>&gt;<i> General MIDI range, so I'd have to rewrite almost every song. Also, I'm
</I>&gt;<i> rendering them on a thousand-dollar tone generator - I sincerely hope
</I>&gt;<i> that there is no way of getting the same quality for free. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I think that from an artist's point of view, not having the
</I>&gt;<i> slightest idea of what your work will sound like on the players'
</I>&gt;<i> computers is not acceptable, especially when it's just for saving a few
</I>&gt;<i> megabytes. I remember playing old games that came with MIDI files
</I>&gt;<i> because they had to fit on a few floppy disks (for example, old
</I>&gt;<i> LucasArts adventures). I used to complain about how crappy the music was
</I>&gt;<i> because I had a crappy sound card. Rendering the same MIDI files on
</I>&gt;<i> modern hardware makes me feel sympathy for the composers, because only a
</I>&gt;<i> small percentage of the audience really got an idea of what the songs
</I>&gt;<i> were intended to sound like: Namely, other musicians who used the same
</I>&gt;<i> hardware. I discovered that tunes that sounded like cheap background
</I>&gt;<i> music on a SoundBlaster16 were actually works of high composing skill. I
</I>&gt;<i> still have a long way to go before I can write music like they can, but
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should make use of the ways we have now to make the music
</I>&gt;<i> sound as good as possible. I agree that the tarball is pretty big, but
</I>&gt;<i> file size isn't that much of a problem anymore. Especially people who
</I>&gt;<i> play games are used to much bigger downloads.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for reducing the quality: I currently compress the songs to 160kb
</I>&gt;<i> Ogg, and even with that relatively high quality rate, the difference to
</I>&gt;<i> the uncompressed originals is clearly audible (which really surprised
</I>&gt;<i> me). Especially in the high-frequency range, such as the piano part on
</I>&gt;<i> bossattack.ogg. I'll still have to try using stronger compression but
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure I won't like the results. Maybe that's just because I've heard
</I>&gt;<i> them uncompressed, and because I know every single note of every song -
</I>&gt;<i> so maybe I'm not the one who should judge over whether the quality is
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient. I'll also try fiddling with my recording chain to squeeze a
</I>&gt;<i> little more quality out of it at the same compression rate. And I guess
</I>&gt;<i> I could go down to 128kb if size really matters to you. :-) But I
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't like to go below that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for the sound track CD that is supposed to be released with Milestone
</I>&gt;<i> 2, I'm planning to make it available as a disc image containing the
</I>&gt;<i> uncompressed music. I wonder how that will affect the decision on the
</I>&gt;<i> in-game quality. Will people notice the difference? And if they do, will
</I>&gt;<i> they care? And if they care, will they bother to compress the tracks
</I>&gt;<i> themselves and replace the ones we shipped? Or will they want to know
</I>&gt;<i> why we didn't do so ourselves?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for the long rant. But I think that the loss of quality that comes
</I>&gt;<i> with stronger compression doesn't justify the few megabytes we'd save.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Beg pardon, but Linux and MIDI? I tried to create that relationship a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; few years back. Didn't work out. I'm pretty sure Wansti can acknowledge
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how hard it is to get it working. And yes, the Roland DLS sound bank
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distributed with Windows (and I fear Mac too) makes all the instruments
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sound like... it sucks so much I can't come up with a good analogy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As for bruting the music down, &quot;-q -1&quot; of oggenc makes me hear a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; difference between the high-frequency abrupt sounds (= the claps in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bossattack.ogg; the whole drum set in cave.ogg, chipdisko.ogg,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; forest3.ogg, fortress.ogg and theme.ogg; the flutes in forest.ogg and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; forest2.ogg) and I get ugly aural artifacts during the longer chords in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; leveldone*.ogg.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As for the sizes:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -rw-r--r--   1 ondra  ondra     674K Jan  6 10:48 bruted/forest.ogg
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -rw-r--r--   1 ondra  ondra       2M Apr  9  2006 forest.ogg
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I boldly state what I always state: &quot;Let's wait for the man in charge.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Id est: let's wait for Wansti and see if he has any troubles when we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distort his works like this. ;-)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; sik0fewl just brought up that the filesize of the supertux tarball is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; a little extra-large and I agree. A quick look tells us that 24MB are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; music, which seems rather wastefull given that the rest is just 12MB
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (and even that could probally be cut down quite a bit):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; -rw-r--r-- 1 ingo ingo 12M 2007-01-06 08:25
</I>&gt;<i> supertux-0.3.0-without-music.tar.bz2
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; -rw-r--r-- 1 ingo ingo 36M 2007-01-06 08:22 supertux-0.3.0.tar.bz2
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; A quick brute force attempt reencoding the music with the lowest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; quality setting brought quite a good improvment, havn't tested with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; all files, just the forest.ogg one (from 3MB down 1.2MB):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; -rw-r--r-- 1 ingo ingo 2985475 2006-12-18 00:22 forest-original.ogg
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; -rw-r--r-- 1 ingo ingo 1176902 2007-01-06 08:32 forest-lowest.ogg
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Sound quality still sounded quite ok, with no noticable artefacts.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Another way would of course be to just use the MIDI files directly in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the game and thus cut down the size of the music to almost none, sound
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; quality would of course suffer a bit then.
