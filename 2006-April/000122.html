<PRE>Folks of Supertux,

    As part of a machine learning testbed, I want to add a &quot;remote 
control&quot; API to Supertux.  This will allow another program sitting as a 
client on a port to Supertux to supply button information for tux and 
receive back which icons are visible on the screen and where.  Because 
the client program may be slow, it will have to have control the advance 
of Supertux time, and thus in this mode, Supertux will not be &quot;real 
time&quot;.  (Perhaps it might even be faster!^)  Repeatability of runs is 
also desirable, so control of random number seeds must be gained.

   The following questions to your group are on my mind:

   1. What work is ongoing that would help me with this effort?  I
      noticed a post about a console.
   2. What is the right forum to pick people's brains, with further
      design questions? I notice a lot of game-play programming activity
      in <A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/mail/?group_id=3467">http://developer.berlios.de/mail/?group_id=3467</A> , but little
      with the &quot;engine&quot; part.  Are there specific people who specialize
      in the &quot;engine&quot; parts of Supertux?  Who are they?
   3. What would it take to have the &quot;remote control&quot; operation, given
      it works and is well structured, be incorporated into the Supertux
      codebase? I would supply documentation of the API, and a minimum
      diagnostic demo as an example of the API's use.   Do I just submit
      a patch and pray, are there &quot;powers to be&quot; that nod and give me
      svn access, or what? 
   4.  From the standpoint of the Supertux community, what is the
      desirability of having a &quot;remote control&quot; ability incorporated
      into the mainline Supertux code base?  I see the following
      advantages: a) automated testing of Supertux, b) increasing the
      Supertux user community with people, like myself, interested in
      machine learning, and c) &quot;it's easy, why not!&quot;

   So I've actually been fiddling with a copy of the supertux source (an 
svn checkout on 4/6/06).  So far I have built a PortServerController 
subclass of Controller, instantiated it in supertux in a very simple way 
(alongside of JoystickKeyboardController), which talks via ports to a 
lightweight client.   So here is my plan, which I'd like to pick your 
collective brains about:

   1. The plan is to have my PortServerController register using
      tux.set_controller, and buttons should &quot;just work&quot;.
   2. I was planning on adding two class variable to game_session, one
      to fix the increments of time simulated to a fixed value, and the
      other to stop simulation to wait for more API commands. The plan
      is to add where needed (bracketed by if statements) the code for
      non-real time (port) operation.  These notions are currently
      &quot;fuzzy&quot;, I suspect there are better ones.
   3. How to gather object info to send back is a few days out for me. 
      Thought was to add a statusString serialization method to some of
      the game object classes, and just package up the results.  I am
      interested in a block name/UID which will be stable over
      revisions, perhaps some basic properties (like solid, background,
      sprite (for tux, bad guys, and coinage), etc).  Also the game
      status line.
   4. The following is last: modifications for random number generator
      repeatability would be as follows:  In normal operation, the
      random seed (probably selected by time()) would printed out on a
      console.  If that run was interesting, it would be possible to
      force that seed with config code.  Are any efforts to this effect
      already in the code?
   5. Does this plan look sane?  Are there other ways to accomplish my
      goals which come to mind?  Are there ongoing changes to the
      &quot;engine&quot; which I sould know about?


Hope that you can guide my effort, and that my work can contribute to 
Supertux.  All opinions, thoughts, and help are welcome.

    Allen King
