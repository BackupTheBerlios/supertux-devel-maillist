&gt;<i> I've been working on the &quot;Remote Control&quot; changes to Supertux that we
</I>&gt;<i> talked about last week, and have a first version that works -- I have
</I>&gt;<i> a program that supplies button presses from a canned list to supertux
</I>&gt;<i> over a port, and supertux returns a list of all the surfaces drawn,
</I>&gt;<i> with texture file names.  The changes are still fluid, so I'm inclined
</I>&gt;<i> not going to release any patches right yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I told Matze I would next make a patch for platform independent
</I>&gt;<i> repeatable random numbers, and I am well on my way to completing that.
</I>&gt;<i> To finish,  I have some (seven) questions on the mods, which I would
</I>&gt;<i> like responses to (the first 3 are generic fishing and educational, on
</I>&gt;<i> the last 4 I need detailed answers):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BASIC DESIGN:
</I>&gt;<i>         1) allows for two random generator modes, under control of the
</I>&gt;<i>         configuration file:  
</I>&gt;<i>                 a. If a (random_seed &lt;decimal number&gt;) line is present
</I>&gt;<i>                 in the configuration file, it is used used as the
</I>&gt;<i>                 random seed to start the run.  
</I>&gt;<i>                 
</I>&gt;<i>                 b. If the above line isn't there, the seed obtained
</I>&gt;<i>                 from time() in the usual way, and is additionally
</I>&gt;<i>                 printed, so it can later be pasted into the
</I>&gt;<i>                 configuration file if the run wants to be reproduced.
</I>&gt;<i>         QUESTION #1: seem reasonable?
</I>The deterministic random number generator is needed for 2 use cases:
Saving Demos and Doing reproducible runs with your AI code. For the
first case we have to save the seed in the demo file, in your case you
probably want to send the seed over network. That would make alot more
sense than putting it into a config file IMO.

&gt;<i>         2)  Files [.cpp/.hpp] for a platform-independent class
</I>&gt;<i>         RandomNumbers were added.  They were transliterated from C
</I>&gt;<i>         sources found at
</I>&gt;<i>         <A HREF="http://www.jbox.dk/sanos/source/lib/random.c.html.">http://www.jbox.dk/sanos/source/lib/random.c.html.</A>  A wizard
</I>&gt;<i>         friend of mine claimed this to be &quot;the fastest and best
</I>&gt;<i>         quality&quot; around.  
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         QUESTION #2: any reason not to proceed this way? Is copyleft
</I>&gt;<i>         okay for supertux?
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>Yep this is the most important part of all this. I personally would call
the calss Random or RandomGenerator though...

&gt;<i>         3) I've included RandomNumbers in a wrapper file &quot;rand.hpp&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>         which redefines rand() and srand() for general consumption by
</I>&gt;<i>         supertux. WARNING: Supertux files which call rand() or srand()
</I>&gt;<i>         and which do NOT include rand.hpp will use the old rand
</I>&gt;<i>         facility, which will be neither initialized correctly,
</I>&gt;<i>         controllable by config, nor platform independent.  So this
</I>&gt;<i>         would not happen, I buried an include for rand.hpp deep in
</I>&gt;<i>         game_object.hpp, which is included by all the &quot;bad guys&quot;.  I
</I>&gt;<i>         also (redundantly) added similar includes in all .cpp files
</I>&gt;<i>         which contained calls to [s]rand(), with a shameless
</I>&gt;<i>         promotional comment, so developers would get the idea.
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         QUESTION #3: any objections to this?  suggestions of better
</I>&gt;<i>         ways (e.g. changing calls to rand to BlaBlaRand, and
</I>&gt;<i>         redefining rand() and srand() to print helpful errors?
</I>
Please don't do that. It's not the C library implementation of rand and
srand anymore, so don't make it look like it is. Also searching for
errors is actually easier if you rename the function, because then you
can simply grep for rand() to find (forbidden) usages of libc functions.
(Additionally adding #includes into heavily used header files is
something that should be avoided too, because it unnecessarily increases
compile time and pollutes the namespace)

&gt;<i> SUPERTUX FUNCTIONALITY:
</I>&gt;<i>         4) There is a call to srand() in player.cpp, which occurs
</I>&gt;<i>         after a player is killed.  I do not understand why it would be
</I>&gt;<i>         necessary to do this -- it seems totally superfluous, but with
</I>&gt;<i>         my very limited knowledge am way too afraid to comment it out.
</I>&gt;<i>         It would be great if it could go!  As it stands now, random
</I>&gt;<i>         number repeatability  ceases after the first time Tux dies. 
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         QUESTION #4 (THIS IS THE REASON I WROTE THIS EMAIL): Could
</I>&gt;<i>         someone verify that this call was just put in by someone who
</I>&gt;<i>         didn't understand random numbers (or not)?  If so, the
</I>&gt;<i>         solution is simple.  If not, not.
</I>Yep remove it.
&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         5) There is another call to srand() in sqstdmath.cpp, but
</I>&gt;<i>         nobody in supertux-ville seems to call the routine that
</I>&gt;<i>         contains it.  I added an throw of runtime_error to discourage
</I>&gt;<i>         its future use.  
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         QUESTION #5: Is this okay, or too harsh.
</I>
All the code in src/squirrel is just a 1:1 copy of the squirrel
scripting language into the supertux sources. Changes there don't make
sense as when there's an update to squirrel, I'll just copy over the new
squirrel files into these directories and the changes will be lost.

I'd propose to simply ignore this issue for now :) If you wanna fix it
then the way to go would be reimplmenting all squirrel library functions
that deal with random numbers in supertux and replace the squirrel ones
with the supertux ones in the roottable.
&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         6) I was thinking of adding a commented-out setting of
</I>&gt;<i>         random_seed in the default ~/.supertux/config . (I noted that
</I>&gt;<i>         that was made for me when I first ran supertux, but a cursory
</I>&gt;<i>         scan didn't show me how.)
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         QUESTION #6:  Can someone help me determine how I would modify
</I>&gt;<i>         the default ~/.supertux/config?  I will do this if someone
</I>&gt;<i>         does.
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>Default values come from Config::Config() constructor and the file is
written in the Config::save() function. But as stated above I don't
think putting the seed into the config is a good idea.

&gt;<i>         7)  One could turn on/off the use of platform-independent
</I>&gt;<i>         random_numbers with a ./configure --&lt;option&gt; .  
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         QUESTION #7: Is it worth doing?  Enough so that someone could
</I>&gt;<i>         outline the requisite changes to  configure.ac (and friends).
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>1 way of doing things is really enough here, we have fewer bloat and
maintainence problems by not having additional options.

Greetings,
	Matze
