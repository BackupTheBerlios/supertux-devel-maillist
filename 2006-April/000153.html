<PRE>
Chris, Matt, et. al.

Great feedback.  This is converging.   I will resurface in a couple of 
days with a patch.  The patch will have only the minimal testing I can 
do on it, which is play the game for a while.  Also I won't be able to 
generate the patch until I get the instructions, which are on the wiki 
(which is down), or perhaps someone could send me them.

Based on what I understand, here is what I'm going to do.  (Things that 
are new or potentially contentious are in red.)

Question #1:

    a) Agree with Matze: Cross-platform random reproducibility is mostly
    useful for play-demo.  I will mostly use it to reproduce bugs
    encountered on long otherwise unreproducible runs.

    b) Added storage of seed in demo-file during demo_record, and recall
    in play_demo.  The implementation chosen adds a string, like
    &quot;random_seed=1382233972&quot;, at the front of the file.  The player will
    now play files with or without the random seed string.  (It makes
    the reasonable assumption that files without a random seed don't
    begin with &quot;random_seed=&quot;.)

    c) For my purposes, config settings is adequate, and it already
    works.  It is also a general tool.  I don't need network setting. 
    If someone has a religious objection, let me know.

Question #2: 

    a) I have called the random class RandomGenerator.
    b) Having heard no objections, I will use referenced code, with
    copyleft as shown. (<A HREF="http://www.jbox.dk/sanos/source/lib/random.c.html">http://www.jbox.dk/sanos/source/lib/random.c.html</A>)

Question #3:

    a) Will make different names for the random calls as suggested. 
    Good feedback, good reasons.  Now, I need a *short memorable proper
    *name for it.  Currently thinking of SDL_rand() (as that is what it
    really is, and currently SDL doesn't have one). Another possibility
    is tux_rand().  Suggestions?
    b) Will put includes for RandomGenerator only in .cpp files using
    RandomGenerator, to minimize compile times.

Question #4: will comment out the call to srand in player.cpp

Question #5:

    a) will ignore squirrel's use of srand for now.  Note: squirrel's
    use of math_rand() properly uses SDL_rand().
    b) There is a case to be made for making SDL_srand() a nop.  I
    propose that, over furthur objections.
    c) Note Matze: If next time you import squirrel, you just &quot;copy it
    over&quot; (as you said in your email), you will wipe out the calls to
    SDL_rand() and break the repeatability!!!

Question #6: will not change generations of ~/.supertux/config

Question #7: will not add option to ./config


Thanks...

    Allen

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with texture file names.  The changes are still fluid, so I'm inclined
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not going to release any patches right yet.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I told Matze I would next make a patch for platform independent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> repeatable random numbers, and I am well on my way to completing that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To finish,  I have some (seven) questions on the mods, which I would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like responses to (the first 3 are generic fishing and educational, on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the last 4 I need detailed answers):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BASIC DESIGN:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         1) allows for two random generator modes, under control of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         configuration file:  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 a. If a (random_seed &lt;decimal number&gt;) line is present
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 in the configuration file, it is used used as the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 random seed to start the run.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 b. If the above line isn't there, the seed obtained
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 from time() in the usual way, and is additionally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 printed, so it can later be pasted into the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 configuration file if the run wants to be reproduced.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         QUESTION #1: seem reasonable?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> The deterministic random number generator is needed for 2 use cases:
</I>&gt;<i> Saving Demos and Doing reproducible runs with your AI code. For the
</I>&gt;<i> first case we have to save the seed in the demo file, in your case you
</I>&gt;<i> probably want to send the seed over network. That would make alot more
</I>&gt;<i> sense than putting it into a config file IMO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         2)  Files [.cpp/.hpp] for a platform-independent class
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         RandomNumbers were added.  They were transliterated from C
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         sources found at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         <A HREF="http://www.jbox.dk/sanos/source/lib/random.c.html.">http://www.jbox.dk/sanos/source/lib/random.c.html.</A>  A wizard
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         friend of mine claimed this to be &quot;the fastest and best
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         quality&quot; around.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         QUESTION #2: any reason not to proceed this way? Is copyleft
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         okay for supertux?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> Yep this is the most important part of all this. I personally would call
</I>&gt;<i> the calss Random or RandomGenerator though...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         3) I've included RandomNumbers in a wrapper file &quot;rand.hpp&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         which redefines rand() and srand() for general consumption by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         supertux. WARNING: Supertux files which call rand() or srand()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         and which do NOT include rand.hpp will use the old rand
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         facility, which will be neither initialized correctly,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         controllable by config, nor platform independent.  So this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         would not happen, I buried an include for rand.hpp deep in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         game_object.hpp, which is included by all the &quot;bad guys&quot;.  I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         also (redundantly) added similar includes in all .cpp files
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         which contained calls to [s]rand(), with a shameless
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         promotional comment, so developers would get the idea.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         QUESTION #3: any objections to this?  suggestions of better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         ways (e.g. changing calls to rand to BlaBlaRand, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         redefining rand() and srand() to print helpful errors?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please don't do that. It's not the C library implementation of rand and
</I>&gt;<i> srand anymore, so don't make it look like it is. Also searching for
</I>&gt;<i> errors is actually easier if you rename the function, because then you
</I>&gt;<i> can simply grep for rand() to find (forbidden) usages of libc functions.
</I>&gt;<i> (Additionally adding #includes into heavily used header files is
</I>&gt;<i> something that should be avoided too, because it unnecessarily increases
</I>&gt;<i> compile time and pollutes the namespace)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SUPERTUX FUNCTIONALITY:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         4) There is a call to srand() in player.cpp, which occurs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         after a player is killed.  I do not understand why it would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         necessary to do this -- it seems totally superfluous, but with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         my very limited knowledge am way too afraid to comment it out.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         It would be great if it could go!  As it stands now, random
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         number repeatability  ceases after the first time Tux dies. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         QUESTION #4 (THIS IS THE REASON I WROTE THIS EMAIL): Could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         someone verify that this call was just put in by someone who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         didn't understand random numbers (or not)?  If so, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         solution is simple.  If not, not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> Yep remove it.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         5) There is another call to srand() in sqstdmath.cpp, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         nobody in supertux-ville seems to call the routine that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         contains it.  I added an throw of runtime_error to discourage
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         its future use.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         QUESTION #5: Is this okay, or too harsh.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the code in src/squirrel is just a 1:1 copy of the squirrel
</I>&gt;<i> scripting language into the supertux sources. Changes there don't make
</I>&gt;<i> sense as when there's an update to squirrel, I'll just copy over the new
</I>&gt;<i> squirrel files into these directories and the changes will be lost.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd propose to simply ignore this issue for now :) If you wanna fix it
</I>&gt;<i> then the way to go would be reimplmenting all squirrel library functions
</I>&gt;<i> that deal with random numbers in supertux and replace the squirrel ones
</I>&gt;<i> with the supertux ones in the roottable.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         6) I was thinking of adding a commented-out setting of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         random_seed in the default ~/.supertux/config . (I noted that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         that was made for me when I first ran supertux, but a cursory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         scan didn't show me how.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         QUESTION #6:  Can someone help me determine how I would modify
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         the default ~/.supertux/config?  I will do this if someone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         does.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> Default values come from Config::Config() constructor and the file is
</I>&gt;<i> written in the Config::save() function. But as stated above I don't
</I>&gt;<i> think putting the seed into the config is a good idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         7)  One could turn on/off the use of platform-independent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         random_numbers with a ./configure --&lt;option&gt; .  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         QUESTION #7: Is it worth doing?  Enough so that someone could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         outline the requisite changes to  configure.ac (and friends).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> 1 way of doing things is really enough here, we have fewer bloat and
</I>&gt;<i> maintainence problems by not having additional options.
