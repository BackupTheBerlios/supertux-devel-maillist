No problem. I had nothing better to do :)

&gt;<i> Changes to the wrapper as you did was the right thing to do.  Thanks for not

</I>
Actually, Matze decided it would probably be best if we just
interfaced the rand() function instead, to keep it simpler for those
doing scripting, so he simply overrode the sqstdmath's rand()
function.

&gt;<i>  I suspect the changes of 0.36 to 3.6 were substantive changes to the
</I>&gt;<i> operation of supertux.
</I>
Yeah, it was causing infinite loops on levels with particle effects.
You made a mistake in your multiplication. No biggy.

&gt;<i>  However, there were some problems when I retested.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The relative order of a) inz playdemo; b) inz random; c) inz recorddemo is
</I>&gt;<i> important in main.cpp:483. (Playdemo might reads and sets the seed that
</I>&gt;<i> initializes random, while recorddemo writes out the seed just used.)  It
</I>&gt;<i> appears the changes to that effect in the first patch didn't get in.
</I>
Hmm.. I might have fiddled with the order when doing some debugging. I
can change it back.

&gt;<i> It appears that a player dieing now no longer re-invokes MainLoop::run, but
</I>&gt;<i> instead is done entirely inside an an update() method inside run.  That
</I>&gt;<i> breaks the rand_prints logic, and hence it was removed. No problem (just
</I>&gt;<i> more printouts during test).
</I>
That wasn't me :)

&gt;<i> Other changes made, just because it's hard to
</I>&gt;<i> debug w/o improving code, are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Improved RandomGenerator, consolidating method definitions, adding debug
</I>&gt;<i> printouts, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> The format of the string written in the demo for the random_seed has
</I>&gt;<i> changed, to make debugging easer. (has no leading 0's (easier debugging,
</I>&gt;<i> matches loginfo &lt;&lt; random_seed) Attached is a patch file.  (It is 10% the
</I>&gt;<i> size of the previous ;^)
</I>
Improved code is almost always good :) I will commit it shortly. Could
send your patches as attachments from now on? It's easier to download
than to copy &amp; paste and makes the email less of a mess.

Thanks,
Ryan
