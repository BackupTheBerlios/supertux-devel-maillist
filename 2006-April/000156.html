</I>&gt;<i>  Great feedback.  This is converging.   I will resurface in a couple of days

</I>
The wiki is back up (for now).

Run &quot;svn diff &gt; my.patch&quot; from the supertux/ directory to create a
patch file. You can also use &quot;svn diff file1 file2 file3 ... &gt;
my.patch&quot; to only make diffs from the files you specify.

&gt;<i>  Question #1:
</I>
&gt;<i>  c) For my purposes, config settings is adequate, and it already works.  It
</I>&gt;<i> is also a general tool.  I don't need network setting.  If someone has a

</I>
What are you putting in the config settings? I thought you were just
holding a random seed, which is now in the demo files? Or do you
loading the random seed for your remote control from the config? If
so, I would think it would make the most sense to actually set it
remotely.

&gt;<i>  Question #2:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a) I have called the random class RandomGenerator.
</I>
Sounds good.

&gt;<i>  b) Having heard no objections, I will use referenced code, with copyleft as
</I>&gt;<i> shown. (<A HREF="http://www.jbox.dk/sanos/source/lib/random.c.html">http://www.jbox.dk/sanos/source/lib/random.c.html</A>)
</I>
Yep, that code is okay. It is GPL compatible (I think it's BSD, but
I'm too lazy to check :).

&gt;<i> Question #3:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a) Will make different names for the random calls as suggested.  Good
</I>&gt;<i> feedback, good reasons.  Now, I need a short memorable proper name for it.
</I>&gt;<i> Currently thinking of SDL_rand() (as that is what it really is, and
</I>&gt;<i> currently SDL doesn't have one). Another possibility is tux_rand().
</I>&gt;<i> Suggestions?
</I>&gt;<i>  b) Will put includes for RandomGenerator only in .cpp files using
</I>&gt;<i> RandomGenerator, to minimize compile times.
</I>
The SDL_ prefix is for SDL functions and using that prefix would be
confusing. Perhaps RandomGenerator should be a singleton class?

RandomGenerator::instance()-&gt;srand()
RandomGenerator::instance()-&gt;rand()
