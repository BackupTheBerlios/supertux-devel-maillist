<PRE>I've been working on the &quot;Remote Control&quot; changes to Supertux that we 
talked about last week, and have a first version that works -- I have a 
program that supplies button presses from a canned list to supertux over 
a port, and supertux returns a list of all the surfaces drawn, with 
texture file names.  The changes are still fluid, so I'm inclined not 
going to release any patches right yet.

I told Matze I would next make a patch for platform independent 
repeatable random numbers, and I am well on my way to completing that.  
To finish,  I have some (seven) questions on the mods, which I would 
like responses to (the first 3 are generic fishing and educational, on 
the last 4 I need detailed answers):

BASIC DESIGN:

    1) allows for two random generator modes, under control of the
    configuration file: 

        a. If a (random_seed &lt;decimal number&gt;) line is present in the
        configuration file, it is used used as the random seed to start
        the run. 

        b. If the above line isn't there, the seed obtained from time()
        in the usual way, and is additionally printed, so it can later
        be pasted into the configuration file if the run wants to be
        reproduced.

    QUESTION #1: seem reasonable?


    2)  Files [.cpp/.hpp] for a platform-independent class RandomNumbers
    were added.  They were transliterated from C sources found at
    <A HREF="http://www.jbox.dk/sanos/source/lib/random.c.html.">http://www.jbox.dk/sanos/source/lib/random.c.html.</A>  A wizard friend
    of mine claimed this to be &quot;the fastest and best quality&quot; around. 

    QUESTION #2: any reason not to proceed this way? Is copyleft okay
    for supertux?


    3) I've included RandomNumbers in a wrapper file &quot;rand.hpp&quot; which
    redefines rand() and srand() for general consumption by supertux.
    WARNING: Supertux files which call rand() or srand() and which do
    NOT include rand.hpp will use the old rand facility, which will be
    neither initialized correctly, controllable by config, nor platform
    independent.  So this would not happen, I buried an include for
    rand.hpp deep in game_object.hpp, which is included by all the &quot;bad
    guys&quot;.  I also (redundantly) added similar includes in all .cpp
    files which contained calls to [s]rand(), with a shameless
    promotional comment, so developers would get the idea.

    QUESTION #3: any objections to this?  suggestions of better ways
    (e.g. changing calls to rand to BlaBlaRand, and redefining rand()
    and srand() to print helpful errors?

SUPERTUX FUNCTIONALITY:

    4) There is a call to srand() in player.cpp, which occurs after a
    player is killed.  I do not understand why it would be necessary to
    do this -- it seems totally superfluous, but with my very limited
    knowledge am way too afraid to comment it out.  It would be great if
    it could go!  As it stands now, random number repeatability  ceases
    after the first time Tux dies.

    QUESTION #4 (THIS IS THE REASON I WROTE THIS EMAIL): Could someone
    verify that this call was just put in by someone who didn't
    understand random numbers (or not)?  If so, the solution is simple. 
    If not, not.


    5) There is another call to srand() in sqstdmath.cpp, but nobody in
    supertux-ville seems to call the routine that contains it.  I added
    an throw of runtime_error to discourage its future use. 

    QUESTION #5: Is this okay, or too harsh.


    6) I was thinking of adding a commented-out setting of random_seed
    in the default ~/.supertux/config . (I noted that that was made for
    me when I first ran supertux, but a cursory scan didn't show me how.)

    QUESTION #6:  Can someone help me determine how I would modify the
    default ~/.supertux/config?  I will do this if someone does.


    7)  One could turn on/off the use of platform-independent
    random_numbers with a ./configure --&lt;option&gt; . 

    QUESTION #7: Is it worth doing?  Enough so that someone could
    outline the requisite changes to  configure.ac (and friends).
