<PRE>Develpoment for milestone2 has been very varying so far. We collected
lots of ideas and are still flooded every day with new ideas from
ourself and others. The engine has gone a major overhaul and we
implemented lots of new features. We have new music new graphics new
tilesets, better tools, a scripting language.

And still looking at Milestone2 we're still far away from it. I think
part of the problem is that development isn't focused enough. We add
random new features everywhere but lack a clear goal of what we need for
milestone2.


I think we reached a point where we have enough new features and stuff
collected for milestone2, it's time to work specifically towards this
release. To achieve this we'll start several development cycles. A cycle
is a set of feature that somehow relate to each other and should be
attacked as a bunch. Once we have a cycle completed we can move to the
next one, but should have everything in the cycle ready for milestone2.
So we'll start with Cycle1:
<A HREF="http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Cycle1">http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Cycle1</A>

Goal:
The goal is to get world1 polished up and integrated to fit Milestone2.

Tasks:

* Make intro cutscene play when the user enters world1 (no savegame yet)
  * Change worldmap to have alternative ways and shortcuts. It should be
    possible to beat worldmap 1 with 7 levels (So users don't have to
    play all 26 levels again to get to world2). All the other levels
    should stay but be on alternative/optional paths
  * At the end of the fortress we need a cutscene to the yeti
  * the yeti has to work perfectly
  * When the yeti is defeated play a cutscene
  * Open way to slide on the worldmap and make it work
  * Make sure all old maps still work

So I'd like everyone to concentrate on these things so that we can
hopefully see some real progress soon! Seeing all the new pieces come
together should give the needed boost to move towards the next release.

Greetings,
	Matze
