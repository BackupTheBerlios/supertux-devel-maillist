Hi,

The game has made a lot of progress while being the Project
of the month at happypenguin.org.
Now I wonder, if the game is still under active development,
or if it is dead now?

Hi,
the game is still under development, rather slowly at the moment, but
steadily nontheless. Latest changes in the development version include a
major bugfix in the collision code, a new piece of music and lots of
forest artwork.

Message-ID: <20060109143343.GA20392@mvonessen.de>

Hi,

I downloaded the source via SVN, because I wanted to play with it a
little. It compiles without giving error,
it runs with complaining about 2 invalid buttons in the buttonmap,
and the supertux themes is being played. But I don't get anything
rendered onto the open window, no menu, nothing.

I run supertux from within the trunk/supertux directory.
The source has been compiled with the default options and debugging
turned on.

I'm running debian etch and compiled with gcc 4.0.

Any suggestions?

love the game I hope there will be more people doing the samething like you. 
can you put a ninja level so I could beat up on ninjas and a cementary and a hunted house level so I could beat up on monsters and zombies. 

Level Ideals
1. japan level-battle ninja and the shogun king.
2. cementary and hunted house level- battle zombies and battle voodoo king and then go to the hunted house to beat up on ghosts and demons and then battle the boss satan jr.
3. robotics lab- to battle cyborg,mutants and other experiments gone mess up and battle the boss robo dino half raptor and half werewolf.

Hi there! I have the latest version of SuperTux for the PSP (PSP 
Edition). I have noticed a bug which you would probably want to fix. 
When you're at the map, choosing which level you want to go to, and you 
highlight some of the levels, the penguin brings you back a level. For 
example, when I bring my penguin to the dot of the level "Tobgle Road", 
it brings it back to the level "Via Nostalgica". Do you know if you can 
fix this bug (if it is a bug or if it's part of the game).  The only 
way for me to bypass it is to go to the level and quickly press X or 
quickly go to the next level. As a suggestion, do you know if you can 
make the snowball (the one that increases your size) move a little 
slower since it moves pretty fast. It's sometimes not enough time to 
actual react towards getting it since it's a surprise. Also, when 
you're invincible from the star, when you return back to normal, do you 
know if you could have some sort of warning, such as that song going 
faster so that you know that your invincibility is running out? Plus, 
when you have the ability to shoot the little snowballs (when you're 
red), do you know if you can make the snowballs travel a little slower 
and bounce less so that it would be easier to hit the opponent? It's 
kinda hard to hit them with the speed it's going and how much it 
bounces. Another thing would be the long load time it takes to go to 
the bonus section, but I guess that's part of the game. Other than 
those things, I think it's fine. Good game, hope you update it, and 
keep up the good work. I've been enjoying it so far! Please take this 
in consideration! Thanks for reading, and good luck in the future!

Hi,

After the GoTM phase of development, activity seems to have
decreased to almost nothing.
Is this game still being actively developed,
or is it dead now?

Hi,

I just made some levels for fun. They still need tome touching-up, but I
wanted to know what you thought? Two of them are hard, one is easy. I
felt most of the SuperTux levels were too easy, and I could design some
hard/boss levels if you wanted. Tell me what you think (I used Mac OS X
so I hope the files work).

Regards,

T. Buck

Hi!
The bugs you describe appear to be only in the PSP version, which was
not created by us. You should directly contact the author of the PSP
port you are using. The invincibility warning has already been
implemented and will be in the next (PC/Mac) version of the game.

Maybe it's the graphics/OpenGL setting. Try starting the game with
"supertux --sdl" and see if that helps.

Hi!
Nice to hear you like the game!
The only way to play SuperTux is to download a SuperTux package for the
operating system you are using and install it. There's no way to play it
online. Of course, you can download the game for free at the download page:

http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Download/Installation

Hey Thomaz.

Thanks for the suggestion. I agree it might be fun to have the GNU
character in the game. I think the current plan for the most part is to
not include any outside characters that are recognizable. If we were to
add in some of Tux's friends to the game the GNU character would get my
vote.

Also, I think we will be switching the info block (telephone) back to
either a ! or a combination of !+?. The telephone may still be used in a
few hidden/special areas.

Subject: [Supertux-devel] Interested in playing around with the Supertux code
Message-ID: <b37300880601281510g63b0f17chcbd2cc6e77d7df18@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all... I just grabbed supertux and am going to be playing around
with it and possibly wrapping it with some Ruby and providing some
modification bindings...

I'm curious... do you have any developer documentation available aside
from what is in SVN?

Anything that would be a good starting point for looking into the
system would be much appreciated.

My C++ is less than stellar, but I know how to write Ruby bindings and
am quite proficient in Ruby....

This is just a little side project that I was thinking of doing in my
spare time, but if anything interesting comes of it, i'll happily
share it.

That's easy, simply add a reference to a keyword or scripted object that
doesn't exist, i.e. write TUX.something instead of SUPERTUX.something or
set_position() instead of set_pos(). Both crashed the game when the line
was executed, locking screen resolution, mouse and keyboard.

What a wonderful game. I just completed it. I don?t think I discovered all
the hidden features, though. You folks should sell the game ? I?d certainly
pay the going price.

Can?t wait for the next voyage.

Thanks
