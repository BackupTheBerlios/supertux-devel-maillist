<PRE>Hi everybody,

--8&lt;--- Release notes --8&lt;---

Supertux Release 0.3.1 (2007-12-20)

Just in time for Christmas, we bring you SuperTux 0.3.1, a preview
of SuperTux Milestone 2.

This build doesn't contain all levels planned for Milestone 2 and
its story is by no means complete, but the game is already fun to
play.

SuperTux 0.3.1 features:

     * new, OpenGL- and OpenAL-based engine
     * final boss for Icy Island
     * brand new Forest World with new badguys and new game objects
     * new and improved soundtrack, immersive sound effects
     * much more...

The changes in more detail: The SuperTux 0.1 engine was nearly
completely rewritten. The game is translatable now, a new camera
algorithm allows scrolling in all four directions. Collision
detection supports slopes and moving objects now. We have scripting
support for dynamic level events and animations. New game objects
include trampolines, switches, portable stones, upside-down
levels, wind, moving platforms and particle effects. The sound
system is now OpenAL-based with an improved soundtrack now played
from Ogg/Vorbis-files, which were pre-rendered on a high-class
synthesizer.

This is also a call for artists and coders: If you like the game in
its current state, join us and help us finish Milestone 2!

You can find the source package (as well as some binaries) on the 
SuperTux home page:
