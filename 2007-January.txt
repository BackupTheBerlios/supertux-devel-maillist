I use a Geforce 3, too. Supertux works in Linux as well as
in Windows XP.

GeForce 3. Oh, had I only had such a powerful 3D card! But still; my
crappy ones run SuperTux in OpenGL fine (even with free drivers ;-D )

Free drivers? I have a 5200FX, and with free drivers, GLXGears reports
200FPS. I might as well not use 3D accel at all!

Unfortunately, as far as I know, gravity cannot yet be adjusted in the
0.3.0 release. The 0.1.x engine was completely reworked for 0.3.0 and
some features are still missing.

However, basic gravity support is present in the engine and just needs
further work, so I'm confident it will be included in a 0.3.1 release.

Message-ID: <BAY121-F3401E7A6E54713DBD8EC22B3BA0@phx.gbl>

Hi I've made a few comments on the bug list about issues I had with sound 
effects being played
only on one channel, I'd prefer to have a stereo option as I am not 
convinced the sounds indicate
direction of origin sufficiently well..

Also I have problems with the separation of the "up" and "jump" controls as 
I am no longer able to
use the <up arrow> key to jump ingame and move up on the map - pressing up 
on the map enters a level...

The other issus I've come across are that some enemies display inconsistency 
when coming to the edge of platforms, sometimes they turn sometimes they 
fall - i've seen an ice-block fall off one platform, walk a bit and then 
turn at the next edge - doesn't make sense to me?

Other than that I find the shooting bonus a lot easier and fun to use - 
making it a much more sought-after bonus, and the bouncing snowballs are a 
lot less nasty in their following pattern than in version 0.1.3..

I'm not a fan of the way the screen scrolls back when you stop moving, but 
hopefully this will be fixed or tweaked in future

great work so far!
Richard

There is no "mono" option. The effects should always come form a certain
direction. Problem with Windows' sounddriver?

"Up" and "jump" are two different keys. If you map the to the same key 
you will also run into problems when trying to jump in front of doors.

Its consistent. If the platform is too high, Mr Iceblock will not jump
down.

I agree with R A on that one. In M1, I mapped my keys so that up meant jump
inlevel, and move up on worldmap too. Then space meant special/run. In SVN,
I tried to do that too, but it wouldn't let me. My vote is to allow the
option to make the up/jump keys the same even if you don't find it a sane
keymapping. I also think up shouldn't affect doors, but action should.
Action makes more sense to me, as tux is in a 2D world, and therefore up
should mean Y axis, not Z axis.   Of course, having those keys the same
might cause programming problems... I'm not sure.

Couldn't we simply tell them that Debian is a broken distro? If they do that
then we can tell them that we are not going to support any user that use Debian
and comes to us and ask for any problem at all.

Another thing that seems bad in that link is:

I hope they don't delete our sound and music, if that is the case, I would
suggest we are not going to support Debian either as the music is important to
the "SuperTux experience".

Well, we don't have to be that uptight about it. However, if the
problem is video related, then I see no problem in not supporting
them.

What DFSG-incompatible sound/music do we use? We should probably try
to avoid this anyway.

We should wait for Christoph to chime in; he's a SuperTux dev and he's
made the NoGL patch mentioned in that post. We can just point people in
his direction in case something is bungled with the Debian version (if
he chooses to support it) or send people to hell^H^H^H^H^H the
autopackage (if he doesn't).

Additionally: no, I'm pretty sure performance will suck more with Mesa
than with the NoGL patch. The SDL-only version does everything in 2D,
keeping the performance around ST 0.1.x levels. Mesa -- believe me, I
tried back then on Linux with 2.4GHz -- makes the whole thing a slide
show, since it's doing 3D stuff for a 2D game on a CPU. Remember the
README: OpenGL and Mesa? 10GHz processor, please. Or buy yourself a
GeForce FX5200 or 6200 for a bargain bin price.

As for the non-free music... that Brulebois guy says he's gonna be
removing it from the package ASAP. He's probably had it lying around to
make his copy of SuperTux a bit more different and didn't know he can do
so in ~/.supertux/music without disrupting ./data/music. (Yes, I openly
admit that I had Rammstein's "Sonne" as ~/.supertux/music/theme.ogg. It
was only a test. Honestly. ;-))

The 10GHz are basically something of a bitter joke. A normal CPU
probably won't be able to accelerate SuperTux with OpenGL, so I (I think
it was me) put this massive number in there. It means, in short, "Maybe
CPUs will sometime be able to accelerate SuperTux, but until then, just
buy yourself some outdated graphics card. It'll save you lots of pain."

As for the verndor [sic], I've fixed it right now in the trunk. Thanks
for the alert. ;-)

I think the problem is that credits.txt mentions "Royalty free sound
effects CDROMs and FTP sites" which is extremely sketchy. To get rid of
that entry we need to find out which files are from a 3rd party and
either give them credit or replace that sound by something we created.
After the discussion on #supertux I started a wiki page
https://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/DataFiles
Everyone please add the origin of sound files you know about there so 
we can solve that problem.

This is a good idea. I was gonna suggest that we keep something like
this in the svn repo, but the wiki is probably a better place to get
the list started. After that we should probably check a cleaned up
version of the file into svn so that it's a part of the releases.

On the Wiki's talk page for that article, I recommended using the Vorbis 
comments to store this information. However, that would mean converting 
quite a few of the sounds to Ogg Vorbis, so we'll have to discuss if 
this is feasible.

If there's no lisence issues, I would think a batch conversion to OGG would
be quite simple... Audacity does batch operations. Can it batch export to
OGG? If so, converting a series of tracks should be quick and easy.

I think it would be a lot easier to keep track of if the information
was kept in a separate, single file. However, I'm all for tagging the
files with the information if the format supports it.

On the other hand, I don't think that we should necessarily convert
everything to vorbis. I think the reason this hasn't been done so far
is because WAV is a lot faster for sfx.

A patch I made has been recently commited so that sector gravity is
inherited by the objects in the sector.  You'll have to multiply the
old gravity index by 100 to get the same level of gravity as before.

Here's a fan-made level I converted to test the functionality.  It's
from "Trot like a Fox" on supertux.info.

I alread mentioned it on IRC, but here again for the rest of you:

Is there any reason why Debian or any other distri for that matter,
should ship 0.3.0 in the first place? As I understand it, it was never
meant to be a 'real' release, instead it was meant as an
engine-preview demo kind of thing. Its full of bugs and annoyances,
the whole Milestone1 world got butchered into a mess, the difficulty
is out of balance and it requires OpenGL for no good reason. In short,
its *not* Milestone2 and its not something I would want to ship to a
wide audience.

So can't we just suggest to Debian and all the other distros out there
to continue shipping whatever is the latest release of Milestone1?

Well, I think that depends on how they do it. 0.3.0 should not
*replace* 0.1.x, since it is only a development branch. However, if
they make both available, so that people can try out 0.3.0, but still
have 0.1.x installed, that should be fine.

I'm not sure what Debian plans on doing, though.

Subject: [Supertux-devel] Tarball file size - lets blame the music...
Message-ID: <87wt408u3q.fsf@gmx.de>


sik0fewl just brought up that the filesize of the supertux tarball is
a little extra-large and I agree. A quick look tells us that 24MB are
music, which seems rather wastefull given that the rest is just 12MB
(and even that could probally be cut down quite a bit):

-rw-r--r-- 1 ingo ingo 12M 2007-01-06 08:25 supertux-0.3.0-without-music.tar.bz2
-rw-r--r-- 1 ingo ingo 36M 2007-01-06 08:22 supertux-0.3.0.tar.bz2

A quick brute force attempt reencoding the music with the lowest
quality setting brought quite a good improvment, havn't tested with
all files, just the forest.ogg one (from 3MB down 1.2MB):

-rw-r--r-- 1 ingo ingo 2985475 2006-12-18 00:22 forest-original.ogg
-rw-r--r-- 1 ingo ingo 1176902 2007-01-06 08:32 forest-lowest.ogg

Sound quality still sounded quite ok, with no noticable artefacts.

Another way would of course be to just use the MIDI files directly in
the game and thus cut down the size of the music to almost none, sound
quality would of course suffer a bit then.

Beg pardon, but Linux and MIDI? I tried to create that relationship a 
few years back. Didn't work out. I'm pretty sure Wansti can acknowledge 
how hard it is to get it working. And yes, the Roland DLS sound bank 
distributed with Windows (and I fear Mac too) makes all the instruments 
sound like... it sucks so much I can't come up with a good analogy.

As for bruting the music down, "-q -1" of oggenc makes me hear a 
difference between the high-frequency abrupt sounds (= the claps in 
bossattack.ogg; the whole drum set in cave.ogg, chipdisko.ogg, 
forest3.ogg, fortress.ogg and theme.ogg; the flutes in forest.ogg and 
forest2.ogg) and I get ugly aural artifacts during the longer chords in 
leveldone*.ogg.

As for the sizes:
-rw-r--r--   1 ondra  ondra     674K Jan  6 10:48 bruted/forest.ogg
-rw-r--r--   1 ondra  ondra       2M Apr  9  2006 forest.ogg

I boldly state what I always state: "Let's wait for the man in charge." 
Id est: let's wait for Wansti and see if he has any troubles when we 
distort his works like this. ;-)

Works fine for me after loading a sound font with sfxload, one could
of course also use timidity and render the music completly in
software. Anyway, just a suggestion, since the whole music is MIDI
anyway, it wouldn't be that bad to have support for it directly in the
game.

Would you notice it in the game? Would you notice it while busy
fighting a boss fight? Would you notice it when not having the other
file directly side by side to compare? I kind of doubt it. Anyway, the
lowest quality setting was just to show that you can make the music a
lot smaller then it is, even the default quality still produces
smaller files. The currently quality settings really are over the top
and just waste of bandwidth.

He will have to do the reencoding anyway, since Ogg to Ogg just isn't
a good idea when one wants to avoid artefacts.

If you got a soundcard that has hardware support for MIDI it works well under
Linux. Far from all people have that.

And timidity has always been problematic for me. On my old computer (a Pentium
4) timidity lagged so much it was impossible to guess what the music originally
sounded like. Even if you weren't doing anything else at the same time.

On my current one (an AMD64) it is worse: timidity freezes X.Org totally. I have
to ssh in to kill it, I can't even switch to a virtual terminal...

Note that if I use the hardware MIDI that I in fact got on my sound card
(SoundBlaster Live! 5.1) MIDI works great, but I have seen very few cards that
have hardware midi, and no onboard sound with it at all...

Well, I guess that means I won't be adding 2 new versions of the Fortress
theme in FLAC format... Setting Ogg encoding to the lowest quality (Q0)
sounds good. I've tried it with more complex songs than the SuperTux themes,
and noticed barely any difference between Q0 and Q10. We're lucky to be
using a codec that sounds as good at low bitrates as Ogg.

Subject: [Supertux-devel] Problems with compiling Supertux on Windows
Message-ID: <000001c73277$324b9660$14b2a8c0@ComputerJan>

Hello,

 

I am trying to compile Supertux (SVN revision 4531) on a fresh installation
in Windows XP Home with SP2 in VMWare, but I am a newbie regarding this and
having some problems.

I tried to follow closely the instructions in the Wiki article
(http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Building_on_Windows) with the
exception that I installed MinGW 5.1.2 and gcc-g++-3.4.5-20060117-1.tar
because the versions mentioned in the article don't seem to be available any
more.

 

On the execution of ./autogen.sh I receive the following error message:

/usr/share/aclocal/autoopts.m4:22: warning: underquoted definition of
AG_PATH_AUTOOPTS

 

On the execution of jam I receive some error messages in a very fast loop,
so I can't read them.

I have pasted the config.txt here: http://pastebin.com/853526 as it seems to
include important information.

 

I would appreciate if somebody could help me with solving the problem.

The warning message you receive is non-fatal. The author of autoopts.m4 
just didn't have the brains to put AG_PATH_AUTTOOPTS into square 
brackets. (Or the m4 language is stupid. I didn't create packages using 
autoconf so I don't know.)

As for jam's error messages: right after the first ones appear, press 
Ctrl+C. (This terminates jam.) Then, copy the first twenty lines of 
error messages to pastebin and link it over here. GCC is known for 
trying to work around unknown language elements by just ignoring them, 
but in most cases, this just generates hundreds of superfluous syntax 
errors because the unknown element was a type definition or whatnot.

I'd guess your installation of GCC is corrupted. Try reinstalling,
preferably from the binary linked on the SuperTux Wiki. I just checked
to make sure the versions I linked are still online - maybe you have to
replace the "g++" in the link with "g%2B%2B" to make the gcc link work,
though.

Btw: I find my "stddef.h" as "C:\MinGW\include\stddef.h". Do you?


Kind regards,

Hello,

I have found that the problem with the linked g++ version is that Internet
Explorer silently replaces the ++ with %20%20. Sorry for that, I have now
installed the version linked in the Wiki.
The problem with MinGW-5.0.0 is that I couldn't get it to work, it just
prints out "Can't download" during setup.

Hm, my stddef.h was in "C:\msys\1.0\include\c++\3.4.5\mingw32\include\".
I tried to move the files in that folder to the place you have mentioned.
But it still doesn't work, the new output of jam is:

Why? Is there any an advantage in storing gravity*100?

Hello All,

First, I would like to thank all the developers for this wonderful 
product. It has long been a myth that there are no good open source 
games out there. I think Supertux shows it is not so.


Second, I am having a problem with running supertux on Vista. I got a 
chance of testing the final release, installed supertux (0.3.0) but it 
is running sooooo slowly it is not playable. I guess it may be a problem 
with OpenGL, but I would still ask if there is a workaround so that I 
can play this great game on my other, Windows system.

Thank you for your help,

Damjan

The first of the arguments passed to main() should be the full path  
to the binary, ie "/Applications/Games/SuperTux.app/Contents/MacOS/ 
SuperTux", as long as it was launched from the Finder.  You can trim  
of the end of the string to find the path the the Resources folder  
and the data folder inside.  This should allow you to work around the  
limitation.

The new gravity is what is used in the engine internally, in
pixels/s^2.  Normalization might be okay, but things are usually
normalized to 1.0, not 10.0

The best solution is not to use vista. It's best to stick with XP, as the
vista downgrade doesn't handle games too well. Anything that sweeps all
hardware 30x per second with no good reason is using way to much of your
system to run a good game. Not to mention, it degrades media without rhyme
or reason....

It is nothing special... AMD64 3000+, 1.8MHz. The graphics is Nvidia 
6600, also not the fastest but should run Supertux just fine. It did on 
Ubuntu and Xp.

Well, I think we were using "real" physics, and the 10.0 was just a
rounded-off 9.8 m/s^2.

I agree. I am just testing the system and am not thinking about using it 
for long. I asked since it is possible that in a month or so many more 
people will start asking the same question and it is good to be 
prepared.;) I read quite a lot of posts regarding Vista and opengl  so I 
thought that there may be a problem here which affects Supertux as well. 
It is not the only game having problems. Xmoto also runs at a snail's 
pace...

Damjan

So why not convert it internally instead of breaking existing levels?
OK, not a real problem, they have to be updated for MS2 anyway.

Default gravity of 10m/s? sounds not really unusual.

No Idea. I neither have Windows Vista nor a machine that might be
able to run it with acceptable performance. So like the Mac Users
you are on your own there unless some other developer goes to the
shop any buys a copy of Vista. Is it already available somewhere?

You can try to update your video drivers, if your hardware vendor
already ships some for Vista.

But, the ST universe is in pixels, not meters.

Doesn't really matter that much, I'll change it to normalize on 10.0
when I get home tonight.

Subject: [Supertux-devel] Patches for lightmap and widescreen
Message-ID: <200701100155.45438.supertux-devel@denkersoft.de>

Hello Supertux Developers!

I have made two patches for Supertux (SVN).
The Patches can be found at http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~kldenker/supertux/

The little lightmap_resolution.patch makes the Level "light+magic" playable at 
any screen resolution. It fixes a TODO to calculate the correct 
lightmap-coordinates in the function get_light.

The second patch is a Widescreen-Patch. It includes a new 
command-line-parameter "--aspect" or "-a". It defaults to 4:3 but can be 
changed to any other ratio. SCREEN_WIDTH and SCREEN_HEIGHT are calculated 
from these aspect-values. This caused some minor Problems with the 
message-boxes and the credits. But I fixed them already.

I hope you can use these patches,
Klaus Denker

this is a little patch that lets the firefly (bell) make a little bell sound

without making it sound bad.

I'm not so sure if that is a good idea. Does that mean that other
hardcoded values like max_drop_height for some badguys or the
X_OFFSCREEN_DISTANCE have to be adjusted? No time to test it 
now, so I did not commit this patch yet.

Theoretically it should work. There is a guaranteed 600x600 square in logical 
coordinates.
The level distances are in logical coordinates, so they are not affected.
The OFFSCREEN_DISTANCE has some bugs at very extreme aspects (like 16:5  -  
SCREEN_WIDTH > X_OFFSCREEN_DISTANCE)

I have another patch to correct some calculations and fix that problem:
http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~kldenker/supertux/offscreen.patch

The OFFSCREEN_DISTANCE-constants are not changed.

This patch is also useful without the widescreen-patch.

It worked, thank you.

I've written another patch which fixes some display bugs. The main menu is 
centered vertically, and the camera centers the level, if it is smaller, than 
the screen. Worldmap gets a background-color if necessary, and is centered 
too.
http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~kldenker/supertux/widescreen_fixes.patch

For testing, i included another command-line-switch, to scale the whole 
screen:
http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~kldenker/supertux/scale.patch

We should think about limiting the Values for the aspect ratio and the scale 
factor, to values of real screens. The aspect may be limited between 16:9 and 
5:4. (are 1280x1024 displays sized 5:4 or don't the have quadratic pixels?) 
The scale factor could be limited between 1.0 and 2.0.

Next thing, I'm going to do, is fix is the demo-recording. A demo recorded 
with different SCREEN_WIDTH or SCREEN_HEIGHT does not play correctly. The 
monsters don't spawn at the same points. So it's necessary to store these two 
values and change them for playback. The screen-resolution needs to be 
corrected too.

as a .package or as source.  The README says:

  == Prerequisites ==

   * SuperTux version 0.3.0 or higher
   * OpenGL driver and environment
   * mono 1.1.13 or newer
   * gtk-sharp 2.8 or newer
              ^^^^^
            (BTW, do we mean 2.0?)

I have Supertux 0.3.0, openGL, mono-core.i586
1.2.2.1-0.novell, gtk-sharp2 2.4.3-1.fedora4.novell.

Here are the error mesgs--

I had this problem myself at first.  You must have gtk# 2.8, not 2.0.
Get the right version at go-mono.com/sources-latest/, or use a RPM if
you can find a trustworthy one.

Hello Marek!

You found me! Actually, I was never approached about including the
song in question i later found out about it via a random googlesession.
I tried to get in contact but no success or answers on mail. I am more
flattered than upset :).

I once way back in time downloaded a  mac version but my skills in
gameplay are really weak and i didn't get very far in the game.

okay.

Soundtrack:

I am a big friend of CC-BY-SA and have no problem with the song being  
included
on the OST.

the game:
??????
since i prior to this mail havent yet granted anything about  
mortimers chipdisko in
anything i will do it here.

"I hereby grant you to use the song "mortimer's chipdisko" in the  
game supertux under the
GNU general public licence. Please credit lukas nystrand as mortimer  
twang as
composer/author of the song."

Lukas Nystrand, Landsbro Sweden. 15th of januari 2007.
??????

Kind regards.
Lukas Nystrand.

Message-ID: <5a5496320701151430n69a1bcxcf12cab4e5b3a11@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

For those who haven't already noticed, the SuperTux project moved to a
new host over the weekend. The reason for this was the poor
performance from BerliOS (the result of a DDoS attack). In particular,
the website has been very non-responsive, but lately it has been
affecting more important things like the Subversion repository. In
addition, moving the website to this new host gives us more freedom in
what kind of applications/services we can run on it.

We have moved the website, Subversion repository and the mailing lists
to the new host.

These are the new addresses:

Website: http://supertux.lethargik.org/
Anonymous Subversion: http://supertux.lethargik.org/svn/supertux
Mailing lists: supertux-devel at lists.lethargik.org,
supertux-commit at lists.lethargik.org

As an extra bonus, we have set up the Mantis bug tracker on the new
website. It can be found here: http://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/

If you are a developer and require Subversion access, please file a
ticket in the bug tracker under the "meta" project.

If you were subscribed to the old BerliOS mailing lists (like this
one) you have been automatically subscribed to the new ones and should
already be receiving email from there. If you had an account on the
wiki at BerliOS, the same account will exist on the new host. However,
you might want to take this time to sign up for the new bug tracker.

gtk-sharp-2.8.2 doesn't compile due to dependencies. 
After much labor, neither yum (including mono.repo)

Would it be too unreasonable to ask for the binaries-
FC4 i686 or so?

I'm not sure. I tried to access it yesterday and the day before with
no luck and I haven't seen FlyingPenguin (I believe he's the one that
hosts it) around lately, either.

Five seconds after my post this happened in IRC :)

[10:21:51] <delta___> By the way - can anyone reach Stephen?
supertux.info seems to be down and IIRC gwater managed that box...
[10:22:09] <wansti> delta___: stephen only holds the domain
[10:22:24] <delta___> Ah, okay
[10:22:46] <wansti> the site itself is hosted by my roommate
currently... he had a hardware crash a few days ago and no time to fix
it yet
[10:23:07] <wansti> i'll ask him to bring back supertux.info ASAP

Can't you install newer FC rpms on FC4? Maybe with some workaround?

FC6 repositories list more recent grk-sharp versions, e.g.

http://redhat.download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/core/6/i386/os/Fedora/RPMS/gtk-sharp2-2.10.0-3.fc6.i386.rpm

Ugh.  Been almost 7 years now.  Don't seem to have any sfx CDs around
these days, and I'm sure the FTP sites didn't _have_ license info posted
anywhere.

Sorry :(  Time to find a microphone? :)

I think the main thing we're missing now is sound effects.

Ah... I'm pretty much useless for SFX. But I'm working on my own arrangement
of Salsa con Carne, and it's coming along nicely.
Wait... Oh crud. Didn't see the part in Marek's original where he said he
was working on one, too. Never mind.

That didn't work exactly but it gave me a few ideas. 
I'm just on the edge of being able to install
gtk sharp 2.8.2, but there's one dependency left that
still eludes:  libpangocairo-1.0.so.0.

Is this lib actually used here?  It would be nice if I
could figure out how to override it if it's not
needed.

IIRC, that's used by GTK to render fonts.  I think it is essential.
Of course, you can try to override the dep anyway and see if I'm wrong
or not ;-)

Nope.  The override attempt was not successful.  So
now  an updated pango .rpm that provides
libpangocairo, depends on libX11 (no version
specified), which I have in /usr/X11R6/lib, but
neither yum nor rpm recognizes it....pbbbbt....

I've been at this for days, pulling out hair and going
nuts...I've never seen these packages be so
uncooperative!  :b   Maybe it's time for a precompiled
version of the editor.  Can one be made available on
the download site?  (Please?)

Try forcing the install of the newer pango.  This is exactly the
reason why I don't use or like RPM distros.  I hated it when RPMs had
false dependencies.

The editor finally installed but not working.  While
installing pango-1.11.5-2:

 [root at localhost pango]# rpm -v -U --nodeps   
pango-1.11.5-2.i386.rpm
 Preparing packages for installation...
 pango-1.11.5-2
 /usr/bin/pango-querymodules-32: symbol lookup error: 
 /usr/lib/libpango-1.0.so.0: undefined symbol: 
g_intern_static_string 
 error: %post(pango-1.11.5-2.i386) scriptlet failed, 
exit status 127

Hmmm...pango doesn't install.  let's see:

 [root at localhost pango]# rpm -v -U --nodeps --test 
pango-1.11.5-2.i386.rpm
 Preparing packages for installation...
         package pango-1.11.5-2 is already installed

Okay...so it is installed, or so they would have me
believe.  All right, I'll play along...

 [root at localhost supertux]# yum install
gtk-sharp2-2.8.2-1.i386.rpm

...That worked.

 [root at localhost supertux-editor-0.3.0]# jam

...Success.  Now we're ready for the big time:

 [root at localhost supertux]# mono supertux-editor.exe &

RPM based distros do really suck... And your mono seems broken as it couldn't
load one of the libraries that is a part of the editor, libeditor.dll should be
in the same directory as supertux-editor.exe after running jam. But as you don't
have your mono built with debugging info it is very hard to interpret the
backtraces (that is, they are unusable).

This error message is not related to pango. It simply means that mono
isn't able to load libeditor.dll, did it build that file for you? Did
you start the editor from the editor directory? (Why are you starting it
as root?)

Whoops, looks like I totally missed this discussion on the mailing list...
I agree that 0.3.0 should not replace Milestone 1 in any distribution.
If they decide that they want to ship both that's fine, but this is a
pre-release which is not intended to replace the current stable version.

Milestone 2, however, is up for debate when it's released. On one hand, it
would mean a new version of SuperTux (always a good thing), but on the
other, we'd get lots of complaints from people without any 3D acceleration.
My 2 cents is that they should ship 2 packages in parallel: supertux and
supertux2. The packages could use the versioning scheme we're using now (
0.1.3 for supertux and 0.3.0 for supertux2), and...
...Dang it, I'm using Skype, and my "2 cents" are only good for a minute.
Alright, my 2-more-cents: the Debian devs are weasels for IceWeaseling their
way out of the FFX-DFSG conflict. If they won't use a non-DFSG image in
their distribution, then why are they shipping a broken version of SuperTux?
Something's not right here... Maybe they should amend the DFSG to ban
patches like these?
*irate hordes of Debianians pick up their pitchforks*
Never mind. Forget I said that. Gimme my 2-more-cents back.

Subject: [Supertux-devel] Tarball file size - lets blame the music...
In-Reply-To: <459F7489.2080506@berlios.de>
References: <87wt408u3q.fsf@gmx.de> <459F7489.2080506@berlios.de>

Actually, I found it pretty easy to get MIDI working. Getting a software
synthesizer to run was a bit tricky, but no black magic. The problem
with shipping MIDI is that the music will sound totally different on
every machine. The music files I'm currently producing are not in the
General MIDI range, so I'd have to rewrite almost every song. Also, I'm
rendering them on a thousand-dollar tone generator - I sincerely hope
that there is no way of getting the same quality for free. :-)
Anyway, I think that from an artist's point of view, not having the
slightest idea of what your work will sound like on the players'
computers is not acceptable, especially when it's just for saving a few
megabytes. I remember playing old games that came with MIDI files
because they had to fit on a few floppy disks (for example, old
LucasArts adventures). I used to complain about how crappy the music was
because I had a crappy sound card. Rendering the same MIDI files on
modern hardware makes me feel sympathy for the composers, because only a
small percentage of the audience really got an idea of what the songs
were intended to sound like: Namely, other musicians who used the same
hardware. I discovered that tunes that sounded like cheap background
music on a SoundBlaster16 were actually works of high composing skill. I
still have a long way to go before I can write music like they can, but
I think we should make use of the ways we have now to make the music
sound as good as possible. I agree that the tarball is pretty big, but
file size isn't that much of a problem anymore. Especially people who
play games are used to much bigger downloads.

As for reducing the quality: I currently compress the songs to 160kb
Ogg, and even with that relatively high quality rate, the difference to
the uncompressed originals is clearly audible (which really surprised
me). Especially in the high-frequency range, such as the piano part on
bossattack.ogg. I'll still have to try using stronger compression but
I'm sure I won't like the results. Maybe that's just because I've heard
them uncompressed, and because I know every single note of every song -
so maybe I'm not the one who should judge over whether the quality is
sufficient. I'll also try fiddling with my recording chain to squeeze a
little more quality out of it at the same compression rate. And I guess
I could go down to 128kb if size really matters to you. :-) But I
wouldn't like to go below that.

As for the sound track CD that is supposed to be released with Milestone
2, I'm planning to make it available as a disc image containing the
uncompressed music. I wonder how that will affect the decision on the
in-game quality. Will people notice the difference? And if they do, will
they care? And if they care, will they bother to compress the tracks
themselves and replace the ones we shipped? Or will they want to know
why we didn't do so ourselves?

Sorry for the long rant. But I think that the loss of quality that comes
with stronger compression doesn't justify the few megabytes we'd save.

Hey, don't stop working on your remix! That Salsa Con Carne thing is not
really my style, so I'm not sure if I can come up with a good
replacement. You're very welcome to send in whatever you've got.

Sorry, but I've abandoned the project permanently. Because I finished
it.Just need to add ID3 tags in Audacity, and I'll...
...Should I merge it into the SuperTux branch as SALCON(mix).ogg (to
separate it from Marek's version) or just email it as an attachment?

Like I said, we're using Ogg, and it sounds awesome no matter how low you
crank the bitrate. I'm trying to find the sweetspot right now, but Oggs are
notorious for sounding clear.

The important part isn't if they will notice the difference, but
simply if the music will sound fine with a higher compression setting.
I mean I could complain all day how a PNG looks superior over a JPEG,
but at the end of the day the only thing that matters is that the JPEG
looks 'good enough', it doesn't need to be perfect, not even close to
it and neither need the music.

Ogg at 160kbs is really over the top, given that most people can't
even tell the difference between CD and 128kbs MP3 given a good audio
setup. Ogg is even better then Mp3 and most PCs audio setup are simply
crap, so I have some doubt that anybody would ever notice, especially
when they don't compare the songs side by side.

Just for the record, 35MB is huge, some people are still on modem or
isdn and downloading that there takes quite a while. I kind of
consider 10MB the target size, I don't expect SuperTux to ever reach
that again, but we should at least try to get a little bit closer then
we are now.

I don't think we should we worrying about the file size too much. Does
20MB compared to 35MB really make that much of a difference? I don't
think so. How hard can it be to get 35MB off the internet? There are
fast connections everywhere, there's internet cafes, CD-ROM's, USB
sticks, flash cards... If downloading 35 megabytes is a problem for
someone, so is downloading twenty. If the only choice we had was between
fully compressed and uncompressed (i.e. 20MB versus 450MB), that would
be a different matter. But 15MB just isn't worth it, IMHO. I'll upload
128kb versions of the songs later today if you want me to.
Distributors always have the option to put the music into a different
package for people who don't want it.

Whether it looks or sounds "good enough" is not the only thing that
matters, IMHO. I think we should try to get the maximum quality out of
the artwork and music that is possible without making it too expensive
on the other end. Like I said, the difference between uncompressed and
160kb isn't worth 400MB, but the difference between "-q 1" and "-q 6"
(or 5) is worth a few bytes.

...Source?... This is music, not code.
Anyways, regarding the size, which is obviously a heated topic: I know
Marek's version is only 15-sec for a reason, so just ask if you want it
shortened or lengthened to conserve space.

Wansti uses Rosegarden for his composition (at least the last time I
asked him he did), which has source files with all the notes, lengths,
modifiers, etc. Then he gets it to "render" (yes, it's not only a 3D
graphics term) it into an Ogg Vorbis file (or a WAV/AU/AIF file,
converting it manually into Ogg Vorbis).

If you use the same method (or a variation of it) with looping programs,
mod trackers, whatever, the "project file" (how it tends to be called)
is what Marek would like to see.

Source as in .midi, .mod, .rg, i.e. native format of whatever software
you used, so I can see how you did it and fiddle around with it a bit. :-)
My remix is not yet finished, I just put the work in progress into the
SVN to replace the problematic one as fast as possible. I'll replace it
with yours soon.

Don't worry about the length, only keep in mind that most people will
probably only hear the first seconds before they move on on the world
map. But I always like it when some nice tunes in the music reward you
for staying a little longer. :-)

I'll send the midi, and about the "first few seconds"... Aren't there some
levels that use it as the default music, as well? Like Torfi's BI2 level
"snarf"?
On another note (pardon the poorly-timed pun), you use Rosegarden, hence the
thousand-dollar tone generator? ;-) I use Melody Assistant, which costs some
minor money (only $20), but hey, twenty dollars for a one-app recording
studio is better than augmenting a GNU app with a thousand-dollar synth.

Some bonus levels do that, but no official levels.

Rosegarden is a tool for music editing, but it doesn't produce any sound
itself. Good sound samples aren't available for free (at least not in
the quality and variety I want), and they come either as hardware or
software (standalone or bundled with commercial audio software). I chose
hardware because it's easier to use, especially on Linux, works with any
other hardware or software that supports MIDI, it enables me to play
around on the keyboard without having to use a computer, and it's a
pretty sneaky way of being able to say "I did that on Linux, without
using commercial software". :-)
My original plan was to go for a completely hardware-based music
production setup in the long run, but I don't think that's possible
anymore - not to mention f**king expensive.

Hi there,
here's what I just emailed the guy who maintains the SuperTux package in
Debian. I hope you're okay with that.

Hi Cyril,
I've seen that you put SuperTux 0.3.0 into Debian Experimental. I
followed the discussion on the mailing list about the license issues
with some of the data files. We're currently working on resolving those
issues by replacing problematic files; I suggest you wait with accepting
0.3.0 in unstable until this is finished.
Since 0.3.0 is only a preview release, I also suggest that you don't
replace SuperTux 0.1.3 with it but rather add it as an additional
package, so people can choose which version to install. People who just
want to play the game might be better off sticking to the old version
for now.
Regards,

    Marek
    (SuperTux Team)

Perfect. Having a bleeding-edge option is what they need. I hope it only
went in Sid, though...

I'm going to put your version of SalCon into the repository. How would
you like to be credited?

Hello

 ASAP, the first version of the patch I was working on named Primatex
Patch, built for
MileStone 1 will be released. This patch includes the new story and
levels built based on
about 10 new tilesets used in the maps. The levels and cinematics of
the main story are completed, and the worldmaps of the bonus levels
are designed, but the levels for them are not
made. The source is not changed, so the patch will be installed
easily, but, there is still a semi-bug with the cinematcis, they will
result in slower loading of the game.

Next mail, I will say the address.
Thanks

Thanks! I added it to SVN. It'd be great if you could also add your
contact info to the table on
<http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Translation#Existing_Translations>,
so we can easily get back to you if there are any questions.


Kind regards,

  Christoph
