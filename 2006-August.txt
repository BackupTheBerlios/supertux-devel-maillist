Hi Danny,

there are many ways to make a worldmap:
1. Using an editor like Flexlay for Linux(http://flexlay.berlios.de), 
but I don't know if flexlay supports worldmap creating, or SWafe for 
Windows(http://www.christian-hoff.de -> downloads -> SWafe). SWafe will 
currently not work with the SVN Builds of supertux.

2. Manual creating of a worldmap file: I wouldn't do that, but if you 
really want, you can use a template file like the Antarctica worldmap 
and modify it a little. But this is not really a comfortable way and 
only useful to understand the file format.

In both cases you have to save the worldmap with the extension *.stwm in 
the (data/) levels/worldmaps subdirectory of your supertux installation. 
In linux the installation path is normally /usr/games/supertux when 
working with Supertux 1.3. The SVN versions are normally installing in 
the user's home directory.

See the wiki for more informations about the file format.

Subject: [Supertux-devel] Network play
Message-ID: <44D120A2.5090806@hotmail.com>

Hello,
I'm trying to make some changes to the code that will eventually enable 
the addition of network play. (These changes are mostly getting rid of 
global variables player_status, camera, Sector::current, etc.)
If network play were to be implemented, should each host running the 
game to keep a complete set of all the game objects, and then 
synchronize them with each other? This would probably be faster, but the 
clients might end up with inconsistent states (due to network delay, 
failure, etc.) Also, it would be much easier for one player to "cheat" 
by modifying their local state. (This probably does not matter most of 
the time.)
Or does it make more sense for only one host to hold the state of the 
game, and for all the clients on the other hosts to simply send events 
to that host and receive (maybe) pre-rendered screens? This would be 
much slower but would ensure a robust game state.
Maybe an intermediate between the two? (I'm trying to figure out how 
Cameras and Sprites should be treated)

Thanks,
gnomino

For the game to be playable over the Internet, I am afraid that neither 
trying to sync two independently running engines nor streaming a live 
video from the server might be sensible.

Thankfully, lots of smart people already tried coming up with good 
solutions to the problems of lag, dropped frames and cheating. If you 
have the time, take a look at <http://www.ra.is/unlagged/> to see how 
Quake 3 tackles those problems, e.g. by using "dead reckoning". Also see 
this site for a solution to serious lag that uses backward 
reconciliation to figure out what a player actually wanted to do. For a 
more theoretical approach to solving the problem of lag, read 
<http://www.resourcecode.de/stuff/clientsideprediction.pdf>.


Kind regards,

   Christoph

Hi ,
I would need some info on supertux_0.1.3.orig.tar.gz that I got from a
debian mirror.
I am trying to build it as a package for the yoper distribution but
noticed that debian uses supertux data as a seperate package.
When I open the tarball I find data there as a folder,that should mean
this .orig.tar.gz has all supertux needs apart from it's
dependencies,no?
Hope to hear from you soon,
regards,
Danny

I took a peek and it seems to contain everything needed to build and run 
SuperTux. Seems like supertux_0.1.3.orig.tar.gz is the original tarball 
downloaded from the SuperTux website with all differences stored in 
supertux_0.1.3-1.1.diff.gz.

According to <http://packages.debian.org/unstable/games/supertux>, the 
"supertux" Debian package is maintained by G?rkan Seng?n and Bartosz 
Fenski, so they should be able to tell you for sure.

Why not just download the tarball from the SuperTux website instead of 
guessing? You can find it on 
<http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Download/Installation#Any_system.2FSource_Code> 
(which links to 
<http://download.berlios.de/supertux/supertux-0.1.3.tar.bz2>).

How about adding coins for the multi badguy hits?
Kill one badguy: get 1 coin
Kill two badguys: get 2 coins
Kill three badguys: get 3 coins
Kill four badguys: get 5 coins
Kill five badguys: get 8 coins
(you guys know phibonachy don't you?)

of course this would lead to a problem with the coin gathering score, but i
think it is a very neat feature.

Love supertux

I think using Fibonacci numbers might be a bit too generous - squishing 
15 badguys would give you the equivalent of 40 extra lives.

Other than that, I think it's a neat idea.

Let's not add this to the "collected coins" score then - problem solved 
   :-)

No, that would only be if you squished 15 badguys in a row, wouldn't 
it?  You already get more points per badguy the more badguys you 
squish/knock out with an ice cube if you don't hit the ground in between.

Yes i was talking about squishing without hitting the ground.

40 lives for squishing 15 badguys? that is too generous indeed, but i can't
remember a level where i could squish more than 5 badguys without hitting
the ground(admittedly though, i never tried to squish as many as possible).

We could just start counting from the beginig after every X squishes, that
also solves the problem.

Well, in some levels that I played, there was a bridge of flying snowballs
that you had to kill to get across, that ended up to squishing 10
badguys.....

I'd simply not give coins for this. Just make it a separate score that
gets displayed in the level statistics. This would mainly be a feature
to increase replayability for people who already played through the
whole game. These people will probably have enough lives anyway, so more
lives/coins isn't really a reward anyway.

Why not keep a separate score per level?
Each replay of a level could create a new score, which could be compared 
against the old one, in the same way that current statistics are 
compared. (# of badguys killed, # of secret areas found, etc.)

I've just make a new badguys : a dog.
I join the files, but since I not draw very well, the pictures are just for 
testing the code.

That's okay, pic-wise, because we have someone for everything on the team,
especially graphics.

Maybe I'd approve of it if it uses a less sharp curve than a Fibonacci. And
besides, ice cubes would be lethal. You could easily knock out 10 at once
with one, which would yield 29 coins and 2 lives. Too broken.

should ice cube even have the same reward mechanism? i remember in SMW there
was a level where you could get a life for knocking out a long row of
badguys right at the begining, but i never checked if it was the same for
squashing(SMW was my first console game.)

We could always devide the phibonacy result by a constant, that would slow
it's growth quite a lot since all the items in the sequence are devided by
that constant.

But i really think hitting with a cube should have a different rewarding
system.

At any rate, i've just finished my calculus 1 course, shouldn't be hard to
come up with a sequence that is fair for everybody if you give me some
pointers what you want to have where(10 badguys=1 life, 20 badguys 5 lifes
for example). I would love to help the development of supertux.

Hey Afief,

In my opinion: No.

Squishing badguys should be encouraged, not shooting them, flipping them 
over with Mr. Iceblock or the Snail, having them get hit by darts and 
the like or just letting them fall off a ledge.

Subject: [Supertux-devel] Nogl patch
Message-ID: <44DAC5E7.9080600@hotmail.com>

Hello,
The addition of ambient_color handling to the video code broke the nogl 
patch. This is a patch against rev. 4144 that fixes the nogl patch.

By the way, why is the nogl patch no longer maintained? So far (AFAIK) 
no key feature requiring OpenGL has been added. I'm sure that the % of 
players using old, non-OpenGL graphics cards is very little, but it took 
very little effort to upgrade the nogl patch(es), so I really think that 
SDL rendering support should be continued.

As far as I know this is because no one of the devs no longer need it (a bit
selfish maybe? ;)

Message-ID: <44DBB532.4050702@hotmail.com>

Hello,
This patch removes Sector::add_bullets() (which was marked with TODO), 
and moves the necessary checks into Player. It also removes 
Sector::bullets and adds a single integer to Player which is incremented 
after adding a bullet and decremented in the destructor of Bullet.

I committed it to svn. It might be interesting for you to know that we changed
from CVS quite a while ago. ;)

Your patch to supertux.desktop was wrong btw.

Message-ID: <44E24627.9050805@hotmail.com>

Hello,
This is a patch against rev. 4186 that implements iceflower. Icebullets 
can freeze some badguys (only the ones I could find sprite images for). 
Mr. Bombs can be carried around while frozen, as said on the wiki. When 
an icebullet hits an already frozen badguy, it bounces off him. 
Firebullets will unfreeze frozen badguys. All non-freezable badguys are 
killed by any type of bullet.
(Is this the right behavior?)

But is it used in any levels? Good idea, I had no clue the flower was
unimplemented until now!

Thats undefined until now. One of the reasons the iceflower was not
implemented is the lack of a fun conecpt for it. Whats the point of
freezing badguys with ice (so they still block tux's path) when you
can kill them with fire? If you already have firetux the iceflower
is a downgrad. One advantage could be the idea from the wiki "Ice
bullets will not bounce like fire bullets, but will shoot out in
a straight path towards the enemy." so it will be simpler to hit
opponents.

Tsch??,
Wolfgang

An advantage could be carriable and throwable badguys(if we allow badguys
other than mr.bomb to be carried too), in SMW there was a boss at whom you
had to throw items(i think it was bowser)

A more advanced implementation could be similar to Yoshy's Island, yoshy can
eat certain madguys and make eggs out of them to be thrown later. if tux was
able to carry a few frozen badguys behind him for a while easily(reads, not
pressing the action key and being limited to one badguy) this would be quite
fun. Imagine tux haolding a rope to which the badguys are connected... i
think this would be quite fun.

When badguys are thrown vertically(like in the SMW) some of them could break
the ice and walk freely again(giving birth to puzzle levels: throw this guy
here and that guy there to press that button... oh well, let's not get
carried away, but it would be cool)

Lets not make a SuperTux just a Mario clone (as said earlier several times ;)).

Right now, there is now way of telling if the frozen badguy is portable
or will hurt tux if he tries to grab it. Btw, if you release Mr Bomb,
tux gets hurt, too. If we want tux to throw badguys we need a lot of new
images. I can't draw them. 

First of all we need a concept, what the iceflower is supposed to do.
Lets see: freeze baddguys, fine with me but wee need a "frozen" image
for all of them. Making some portable and some hurt tux is bad, all
frozen badguys should behave similar. Next problem is losing fire
if taking ice. What about making ice a temporary effect like invincibleness?

Do we need ice for MS2?

Tsch??,
Wolfgang

Throwing a badguy would simply mean moving him along some airy path, would
be fancy if he rotated, but that's not MS2 i guess. I can help with some of
the needed pictures as the "frozen" part seems to be only a semi transparent
layer.

>Making some portable and some hurt tux is bad, all

couldn't agree more.

>Next problem is losing fire

invincibleness?

i think ice could just be as useful as fire, there could be some badguys who
simply shatter when tux collides with them while frozen(similar to legend of
zelda when throwing a frozen badguy) others could be carried and/or thrown.

IMHO playing with ice flower is more fun than fire flower, how else would
tux cross the extra hard ocean levels? of course he has to freez the water
with ice flower abilities :-P

>Lets not make a SuperTux just a Mario clone

I agree, but taking some of the good mario/joshy ideas can't hurt(if it's
planned well and discussed here)

It would be a good idea to make it a semi-transparent layer.
Quite a while ago when I painted the frozen guys (mr. bomb, flying
snowball, fish and spikey as far as I can remember...) I just colorized
a single frame of each enemy's animation and added some
"extra-ice-effects" -- a transparent layer would be a much better
solution of course imho. :-)

Yepp. I agree.... would be confusing otherwise.

The ability to freeze wather would be quite interesting if it's not 
permanently:
Imagine if the a frozen block stays frozen when there is no more wather around 
it. If there is still whater from one side (right, left or underneath) the 
block melts ater three seconds, wather from two sides: melt after two seconds 
and if there is whater from all three sides, the block melts after one 
second...

bye,
Jonas

Whenever I compile the latest version of SuperTux (rev. 4102 on Xubuntu 6.06),
I get the following error message:

If it's not a bug in g++, could someone make a patch for this? This is
preventing me from upgrading revisions, which is becoming a real pain.

Never mind, I upgraded it with Apt and it worked fine. It was a problem with
g++.

I guess we're just all on vacation these days. At least that's the case

Ah. So Nolok's Party Pit hasn't frozen over yet? I'm planning on making some
remixes of ST music themes, but I'm not suggesting they should go into the
next milestone, the versions you made are fine (<3ing the new Fortress
theme), so much as an extra for the fan site.

Cool! Keep me updated about your progress. And about what's going to be
in the next milestone, that'll simply be the one that sounds better. I'm
also planning on releasing a sound track album with milestone 2, and
it'd be cool to put some remixes on that.
