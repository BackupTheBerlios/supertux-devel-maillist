<PRE>Hello,
I'm trying to make some changes to the code that will eventually enable 
the addition of network play. (These changes are mostly getting rid of 
global variables player_status, camera, Sector::current, etc.)
If network play were to be implemented, should each host running the 
game to keep a complete set of all the game objects, and then 
synchronize them with each other? This would probably be faster, but the 
clients might end up with inconsistent states (due to network delay, 
failure, etc.) Also, it would be much easier for one player to &quot;cheat&quot; 
by modifying their local state. (This probably does not matter most of 
the time.)
Or does it make more sense for only one host to hold the state of the 
game, and for all the clients on the other hosts to simply send events 
to that host and receive (maybe) pre-rendered screens? This would be 
much slower but would ensure a robust game state.
Maybe an intermediate between the two? (I'm trying to figure out how 
Cameras and Sprites should be treated)

Thanks,
gnomino
