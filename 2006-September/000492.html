You're welcome. Or was that supposed to be a question? :-)


If so, please provide the version numbers of related programs you were 
using (or trying to use), as well as some details:

- What did you try?
- How did you go about it?
- What worked?
- What didn't work?
- What error messages did you get?
- How can the error be reproduced?


Without such details it's next to impossible for most of us to track 
down the error - it's like me asking you &quot;Why couldn't I eat pancakes 
this morning?&quot; - it could be pretty much anything...


Regards,

   Christoph
