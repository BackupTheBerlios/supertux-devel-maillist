<PRE>hey ho.

The other day on IRC wantsi was trying to point out a specific bug/feature
where holding keys at the right moment causes tux to slide across the
screen on his butt. At least that's what I think we were supposed to see.

I think I just discovered what wantsi was trying to point out. I'm not
sure if it's a bug, seems more like  feature.

Here's how it works:

Tux runs down a sloped hill. While still moving down the slope he speeds
up in continued motion. Pressing the down arrow while in this motion and
still on the slope puts tux in a moving butt-jump position. When the slope
levels out tux continues to slide across the flat ground at run speed. He
continues until an object or upward slope is reached.

The fix that would make this a killer feature would be a jump at the end
of the run/slide. Either a ramp or a small upward slope/bump to send tux
flying. Using the ramp tux could do a butt-slide-jump that launches him to
a high location which is otherwise unreachable.

Here's a composite of screen shots showing my test yeti doing the
butt-side motions. This sprite is still in the works so yeti is missing
his arms :)

At the moment using these key combinations is not possible with my arcade
iPAC joystick control panel, which is still under construction. It would
be worth it to me to have to rebuild my controller panel if someone were
to complete the code for the butt-slide-jump move. ( hint :)

Anyways, just food for thought.
enjoy
