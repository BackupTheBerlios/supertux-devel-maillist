&gt;<i> 4mb AGP video Card
</I>
Could you try to find out the exact type of video card (first screen
when the PC is booting normally shows the type)?

I also kind of doubt the 60fps number, even my Athlon1800+ can just do
50fps in software and on a P3 600mhz I get around 25fps, so 60fps
seems out of reach for such kinds of hardware.

&gt;<i> most Pentium 3 and lower, with a standart 2D card will not work in
</I>&gt;<i> OpenGL mode and will work fine without it...
</I>
As far as I know there havn't been pure 2D cards around for a long
long time (maybe some on-board stuff?), basically everything has 3D,
some of course not supported by Linux, but mostly just exotic stuff.
Everything that is ATI, Nvidia or Matrox should run quite fine. Some
Intel and S3 stuff might be problematic.

Anyway, I started a SuperTux-portable branch in SVN a while ago, that
is however not a port, but a full rewrite from scratch aimed mainly at
the GBA at the moment and optimized for very low system requirements
(GBA only has 256kb of RAM), porting it to SDL should however be no
big issue (its far far from being playable, so it doesn't really
matter at the moment). The reason why it is a rewrite is because there
is little point in trying to make the latest SuperTux running
software, sure it can be done and the patch a few mails above shows
that its reasonably simple, it however neither supports all features
that Milestone2 will need nor does it provide enough performance to be
useable on low-spec systems (zooming, alphablending and such are very
slow in software).
