<PRE>Hey Christoph,

I wanted to say thanks for your recent postings. Looks like you may have
even put some newer bad guy ideas on your website today. I will be trying
out some of your stuff here when I get a few minutes. I really like the
idea of a bad guy that catches/spits Tux's fire shots back at him.

I encourage you hang out/around, stop into the IRC channel and keep
sending stuff into the list.

I understand wanting to put energy in to a non-GL branch/patch. I'd like
to possibly see that continued. But on the flip side, we made a decision
to break in favor of GL only. With talented people working together
towards the same goal we can achieve better results. People with non-GL
will still have the 1.3 release of SuperTux so it's not like we're taking
anything away.

Also of note, your patch/zip with the forest graphics is mostly work done
by our artistic lead, Ingo (Grumbel) Ruhnke.

Keep up the good work and I hope we catch you around on IRC.

-Stephen Groundwater

I read this on IRC today and it made me laugh, so I'm pasting it as my
temporary sig.

lotusleaf: everytime someone tells me they have xp I sigh a little bit in
pity like they've just told me their beloved family member is retarded

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I modified the well-known Spiky to create a variant that sits around on
</I>&gt;<i> the floor sleeping. As soon as the player comes into sight, e.g. by
</I>&gt;<i> passing him, he slowly gets to his feet and walks around.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could be useful, e.g. by following the player into a pit or surprising
</I>&gt;<i> the player from within a hidden cave.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Illustration and demo is at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.deltadevelopment.de/users/christoph/supertux/">http://www.deltadevelopment.de/users/christoph/supertux/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Christoph
</I>
