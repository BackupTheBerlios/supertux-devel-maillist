<PRE>Reforcing what Christoph said, A full OpenGL version of supertux, will 
make many SuperTux players disapointed. At least here in Brasil, super 
tux is really famous among people who doesn't have a powerfull computer 
with OpenGL support.

It would be interesting, if those new effects, that would affect 
gameplay, could be changed for something similar (maybe not  as 
&quot;beautiful&quot; as the GL version) but that could &quot;simulate&quot; the same 
gameplay....
