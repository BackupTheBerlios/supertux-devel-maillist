Hi Doug,
the behaviour you are describing is most certainly a bug, not a design
element. Since it obviously can be mistaken for a feature, I assume that
can be reproduced. Could you be a little more specific about where and
when it happens (and which version of the game and which architecture
you are using) so we can fix it?
Thanks,

    Marek

Is there anyone on the mailing list who can speak Spanish and translate
this into English? Thanks. :-)

Hi Nicolas,
thanks for offering your help with SuperTux. If you want to participate,
you should check out the latest version from the SVN repository (see the
download page for instructions) and take a look at the TODO in the
SuperTux Wiki for a list of things that need to be done. The SVN tree
also contains two new level editors that are currently in development,
which are a lot easier to set up than Flexlay, so I recommend trying one
of these if you want to build some levels (we can always use some of
those). You should also visit our IRC channel (#supertux at
irc.freenode.net) from time to time, since a lot of discussion about the
next version is going on there.
Regards,

    Marek

I think the behaviour he is talking about is that ubuntu jumps to
some(apparently) random spot when he gets stuck under a tile(or so i think)

to reproduce it:
level: into the rabbit hole.
place: when you jump into the hole.
go as far as you can to the right(during the fall), when you reach the
ground go left and you'll be kicked into another place(might be design... it
makes the level easier, but it seems to be a bug)

revision 3615.
platform: GNU/Linux - Ubuntu Dapper Drake(no XGL, 3d acceleration enabled)

Desir?e,
	I'm having trouble translating what you're saying.  What language  
are you speaking?  I speak Spanish (though I am quite out of  
practice) and recognize Portuguese to an extent.  It looks like  
Portuguese to me, but I'm having a lot of trouble translating it, so  
I'm wondering if you're speaking Keres or another lect of Spanish or  
Portuguese.  Do you speak English or Spanish?

	Tengo un problema traducir que t? dices. ?Qu? idioma hablas? Hablo  
Espa?ol (lo siento por la gram?tica pobre; soy bastante fuera de la  
pr?ctica) y reconozco Portugu?s un poquito. Se parece a Portugu?s a  
m?, pero tengo muchas problemas lo traduce, y yo me pregunto si t?  
hablas Keres o una otra variedad de Espa?ol, Portugu?s, etc.  ?Hablas  
Ingl?s o Espa?ol?

Message-ID: <447F1598.6070102@shaw.ca>

Behavior:  Player suddenly runs to right.  It behaves like the right 
cursor key is being held down.  Pressing left cursor, duck, jump or run 
keys does not stop it.  The right cursor key must be pressed and 
released to halt the run.  Then it restarts in a matter of seconds 
usually.  It occurs throughout the game, I just reinstalled the game 
with a fresh .supertux folder and the bug starts immediately upon 
entering Welcome to Antarctica.  I have set the game to use different 
keys to see if it's a problem with my keyboard.  The bug persists no 
matter which keys are set for player movement.

I am running Fedora Core 5 i386 on an Athlon64.  It's version 0.1.3 of 
Supertux installed with yum.  The rpm is version 0.1.3-3.fc5.  I have a 
Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse although this seems to be hardware 
independent.

If I can do anything else to help pin down the problem please let me know.

Thanks,
Doug  Webb

I just uninstalled version 0.1.3 and installed 0.1.2 from your site and 
it also has the bug.

Cheers,
Doug

This is a general problem with keyboards, they're not really built for 
games. Read
http://www.sjbaker.org/steve/omniv/keyboards_are_evil.html if you wanna 
know about the details.
All you can do to avoid it is trying to redefine your keys (or maybe try 
another keyboard).

    Matze

Do you have a joystick connected to that machine?

I've noticed a similar bug myself when I squish a badguy by walking or
running off a stair-step structure.  Tux would suddenly 'teleport' 5
steps backwards and somewhat upwards.

I have also noticed, and it's usually when I was jumping over a 
questionably spaced gap (ie, gotta make it, gotta make it kind of 
jump).  If I think about it, it's also happened when walking, but it's 
most irritating when jumping.

I just sent this to my Brazilian friend who speaks portugese.

Hello Rebecca,
 
No, unfortunately this is not Portuguese; it?s Spanish, but with some 
words that I don?t know - it should be some kind of Spanish with a 
dialect from the place where the person had writen it.

I?ll translate what I understand...

*Hello! You are the one that I believe super "tux" (don?t know this

ok , if you can?t, let me know and I will not register you.*

SOMETHING LIKE THAT!
 
Sorry, I don?t know very much of Spanish

That's a problem with the collision detection.

Does Ubuntu ship the latest SVN version and claims it would be stable
or even playable?

Do you run Linux, Windows or MacOS?

If you run Linux, what distribution do you use?


Depending on what operating system and/or distribution you have, you'll 
need to either

- download and install one of the packages on 
<http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Download/Installation> or

- just use your distribution's advanced packaging tool to download and 
install SuperTux for you.


Regards,

   Christoph

It looks to me like they are having trouble downloading the game.
They can't coger  (very similar to get) it.  I'm fluent in spanish...
their spelling is a little whacked, but I can understand.  If you
would like, I can work with them to figure out what exactly is going
on.

Thanks,

Joseph Brower

No problem.

The SVN version has an insanely buggy collision detection. We are going 
to fix this before releasing Milestone 2, but don't expect it to be 
fixed in the too near future.

Is there anything that I can do to aid in the progress of Milestone 2?
 I know very little C or c++ but I can do some basic artwork, and I am
bilingual if you need me to translate between english and spanish.

Thanks,

Joseph Brower

Thanks for asking. Actually there's quite a lot to do besides improving 
the engine. Just have a look at "Can I help with Milestone 2?" on 
<http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/FAQ> for some good starting 
points.


If, for example, you want to help translating SuperTux, see 
<http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Translation> for a quick 
summary on how to help out there.

For inspiration on what graphics the game needs most, see 
<http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/TODO#Graphics>.

We also need some SFX - read 
<http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/TODO#Sounds> for a list of 
missing sound effects.


If you need any help setting up tools for SuperTux development, you'll 
find people involved with SuperTux on the SuperTux IRC channel 
<http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/IRC_Channel>.


Regards,

   Christoph

Not for a while, we're developing it right now. But if you want to try the
prerelease, go here<http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Building_on_Windows>if
you use Windows.
If you need any German translations, just ask Chris Summer.

Hello, I am Nicolas and i am thirteen years old.
Since i use Mandriva linux i play your game, Supertux.
I thought about sending a mail for asking if i can be of any help. I can use 
well "the GIMP" and i sometimes have ideas for levels. Can i be of any help 
to you for artwork or level-editing?
Thanks for attention.

(p.s: if you are going to translate the game,i can also write in Italian and

Hi Finn,
thanks for your suggestion; Milestone 2 will contain moving platforms.
They are already implemented and the current development version
contains a few levels where they have already been used quite impressively.
Enjoy the game!

Hi Nicole,
At the SuperTux fansite, there is a small section on how to play the game:
http://www.supertux.info/how.html
Unfortunately, it is not yet finished; I hope it's still helpful. If you
have further questions, feel free to ask anytime.

(Note to developers: We should incorporate a "how to play" section into
the official SuperTux documentation, at least for milestone 2. Any
volunteers?)

Might be a problem at Berlios. Try one of the mirrors.

http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Download/Installation#Windows_Installer
|  Windows Installer
| 
| There's an automatic installer here:
| 
|   http://download.berlios.de/supertux/supertux-0.1.3-setup.exe
| 
| The binary is also mirrored on several places around the world - here
| are some of them:
| 
|     * http://www.chip.de/downloads/c1_downloads_16553946.html
|     * http://www.razorbg.de/media/download/21

| Note that we cannot guarantee the integrity of those mirrors, though.

You most probably can. Even if you are not going to create actual game 
content, there's quite a lot to do. See 
<http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/FAQ> for some things we'll 
always need help with.

> Can i be of any help to you for artwork or level-editing?

We already have some really gifted artists on board, but will probably 
never have enough. Feel free to submit some sketches, preferrably 
missing art listed at 
<http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/TODO#Graphics>, so we can see 
what you can do.

An older snapshot of the was translated to both Italian and French 
already, so there are still some strings missing and/or outdated. 
<http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Translation> has some advice 
on how to get started.

Can you quickly sum up what you tried and how it failed, i.e. 
warnings/error messages?

Maybe others have the same problem, so it'd be great if we could fix that.

Message-ID: <4497C6E1.803@gmx.de>

Hello SuperTux Developers,
Last week on IRC, there was a short discussion about whether we will
have another real-life developers' meeting this year.
The meeting would probably take place in Germany again, since (for some
weird coincidence) a lot of the team members live in that area, making
it the shortest overall travel route. My apartment has room for a few
people, so I could offer that as a location.
As far as the date goes, a long weekend in September seems like a good
choice (though not Sept. 9th/10th, please :-)).
Who of you is interested in a meeting, and what are your proposals for
place and time?

    Marek

Hi,

I would be interested in a meeting although I did not work at the sourcecode 
yet. I am living in Stuttgart, which is in the south of Germany. That's why 
I think it my house would not be a suitable location because I live too much 
in the south.  The time doesn't play any role for me, but it should of 
course take place on a weekend.

Hello!

I have downloaded and played SuperTux and have to say it is a great game. 
It's very pleasing to the eyes and just overall fun to play. I really look 
forward to playing any new versions of the game you make. I have spread the 
word with friends to look this game up. Keep it coming!!

Good Luck,

Cynthia

First of all, thanks for sharing your opinion. The developers are 
currently working hard to get a new version out as soon as possible, so 
if anything bothered you about Milestone 1, post here and help make 
Milestone 2 an even better experience.

If you like to, you can also actively help with the development of 
SuperTux. Writing and maintaining the documentation puts additional 
strain on the team's tight resources, so people helping maintain the

You know, thsi is probably too late for milestone 2, but one thing that 
I would find helpful is a level hints thing somewhere.   There are a few 
levels that I just can't figure out....and a hint about how to get past 
some obstacle that seems to big would be cool.

Due to their size and complexity, Milestone 2 levels will contains lots 
of signs like these

<http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/supertux/trunk/supertux/data/images/tiles/signs/right.png?rev=3335&view=markup>
<http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/supertux/trunk/supertux/data/images/tiles/signs/color_yellow.png?rev=3622&view=markup>
<http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/supertux/trunk/supertux/data/images/tiles/signs/danger.png?rev=3335&view=markup>

to help figure out where to go or which switch operates which door.


Would that help or were you thinking of something completely different?

That is along some of what I was thinking.

One of the levels I'm currently stuck on (can't remember which name, 
it's been a bit since I've actually had time to play) has a very large 
gap that I'm trying to figure out how to get over.  Often, it seems with 
a level I've had trouble with, all of a sudden I "get" it, and then 
don't really know what I did and then just hope I get to the end.  I go 
back later to some levels that took me absolute ages to complete and 
wonder why it took me so long.

1. Have you put the boxes unto the "interactive" layer?
2. I'm not sure the built-in editor supports autoscroll.
3. I doubt SuperTux 0.1.3 supports backscrolling.

There are indeed some features like breakable boxes and reset points 
that either didn't make it to the level editor in time for the release 
or were simply forgotten to place in. Most of these features can be used 
with Flexlay, which can make SuperTux 0.1.x levels.

Other features (like backscrolling) are in the engine, but unused 
because they are incomplete and/or broken. If you want to make stable, 
good-looking levels you shouldn't use these, but you can.

The SuperTux fansite forums have quite a lot of posts explaining how to 
do stuff that's impossible to do using the built-in level editor. For 
example, see <http://www.supertux.info/forums/viewtopic.php?id=194> for 
an explanation concerning autoscrolling and breakable wooden boxes.

Rest assured that all three of the features mentioned will be accessible 
in the SuperTux 0.2.x level editor.


Good luck with your levels - and don't forget to submit good ones, e.g. 
at <http://www.supertux.info/upload.html>.

Hey Julian,

Which system are you using? Windows? Linux? OS X?

Hmm... nevermind. From what I have gathered while trying to get to run 
it, Flexlay is *evil*. Compilation is failure-fraught, the required 
development version of ClanLib (one of its dependencies) tends to be 
broken, etc. If you run Windows, you will never, I repeat, NEVER get it 
running, unless you have the brainpower of Steven Hawking. Windows has, 
in my opinion, always been a bitch to native C/C++ developers.

Once we get Milestone 2 running, we'll be better off. The editors being 
worked on (SuperTux#-Editor and Cobble) are written using .NET's C# (the 
former runs on Mono on non-Windows systems) and work much better. (Sorry 
for raving about Milestone 2 and how good it is while everybody is 
already eagerly waiting for it... I need something to contrast Flexlay 
to.) Unfortunately, they are not compatible with Milestone 1's level format.

If, for any reason, you are tired of living... 
http://flexlay.berlios.de/. However, editing the level files in a text 
editor proves to be much easier, even if you hate editing in text editors.

Hmm, if any devs are reading this... could we branch Cobble for 
Milestone 1 as an act of goodwill? I'm quite sure a lot of our users run 
Windows and would be happy with it. (I might just do that in a few 
minutes...)

So... you just scrolled down to the link, ignoring the rest of the
message, right? Well done.

Flexlay does not exist in "program", but only in "source" form. "Source"
is transferred into "program" by a process called "compilation", which,
in the case of Flexlay, just about never works out and you can spend
hours on end trying to fix it to no avail. Therefore, downloading
Flexlay is nothing more than choosing a higher evil than using the
built-in SuperTux level editor.

At the bottom of the page there are two Links to the Sourcecode of two

It isn't hard at all in most email clients. In most email clients you just hit reply. If that

How about you join us on the IRC Channel at 
<irc:chat.freenode.net/#supertux> - maybe we can solve your problems there.

If you are new to IRC, freenode or our channel see

Maybe Yahoo Mail is to blame. They might automatically delete messages 
they consider "junk". Look around the interface a bit - maybe there's 
some way you can tell Yahoo not to delete "junk" messages.

Perfect. I posted this to the mailing list, too. Maybe other readers

I do have a similar problem with these messages going to my junk folder 
(particularily if it's been a busy posting day).  But, I have my 
settings to put what is perceived as junk in the junk folder not the 
trash and I check it every so often and tell it what's not junk in the 
junk folder.  I have one filter set up to put a certain kind of message 
directly in the trash, but that's not a junk mail filter, but a subject 
line filter that I set up myself.

That is your frames per second counter.  The higher that number is,
the smother the game will run.  A low frame rate results in
jerky/choppy gameplay.  If you have opengl hardware acceleration,
enabling it will most likely give you a nice boost in framerate.

THanks,

SuperTux Devs,

I've been looking over the latest milestone 2 development version of 
SuperTux from SVN and have decided that I would like to contribute some 
of my resources to the project.  I have familiarised myself with the 
wiki, and reviewed much of the supertux-devel archives.

I'm primarily a programmer (C/C++) and analyst, but am capable of 
graphic design when necessary.  I initially plan to focus more on cycle 
3 related issues than cycle 2, doing minor bug fixes that I find, fixing 
the collision detection and other things to familiarise myself with the 
source code.  I will come back and try to help on cycle 2 once in a 
while, but my primary interests are on behind-the-scenes tasks.

Cheers,

Daniel Hedlund

Subject: [Supertux-devel] SuperTux Configuration Files (patch)
Message-ID: <44A1120E.5050700@digitree.org>

I've been looking around at the user configuration file for SuperTux and 
have spotted a something that don't seem quite right to me.  Whenever a 
user passes a command-line argument to SuperTux, those command arguments 
are saved/reflected back in the SuperTux configuration file after 
SuperTux is run.

Some example scenarios where saving arguments is bad include:
1.  passing "-f" or "--fullscreen" to SuperTux.  If fullscreen mode is 
broken or gives a black screen, SuperTux would default to fullscreen 
mode the next time it is run without arguments.
2.  passing "-g" or "--geometry ..." to SuperTux.  Consider what happens 
if a really odd geometry gets passed to SuperTux such as "600x800", 
"1000x1" or even "1280x0" (which causes SuperTux to crash but still save 
the geometry in the config); the user will be stuck with this weird 
resolution or crashes until they specify the original resolution on the 
command line ("What was the original resolution?  Doh!").
3.  passing "--show-fps",  "--disable-sfx" or "--disable-music" to 
SuperTux.  Frames per second will be shown in SuperTux forever until 
they manually edit the configuration file and disable it!  The 
configuration file is in lisp which makes things even worse from a 
user's point of view ("(show_fps #t)").  Sound effects and music would 
also be permanently disabled until manually editing the config file.

My solution to this problem is to create two configuration objects, one 
representing the configuration file itself ("config_file") and the other 
representing the configuration file with command arguments applied 
("config").  Whenever the configuration file is saved, it will save the 
version without the command arguments.

In addition, sometimes the configuration was saved each time an option 
was toggled (ex. fullscreen mode) and sometimes it wasn't (ex. 
configuring keyboard or joystick); the configuration file was always 
saved when the game quit though.  I have modified this behaviour to only 
save when the program quits to standardise behaviour.  This is temporary 
as I'm working on another patch that will save all command options when 
the options menu has been exited.  I should have this within a couple of 
hours.

The patch to prevent saving command arguments is attached.

Cheers,

Daniel Hedlund

One question: My FPS seems to be locked at 60. Is there an internal delay?
Should I use something else for benchmarking?

Joseph,

I'm assuming that you're using the development version from SVN since 
you've been on the list a while.  There is an internal variable called 
"LOGICAL_FPS" which is defined in two places, src/game_session.cpp and 
src/mainloop.cpp.  It's currently set to 64.  You should be able to 
change this value to something else and recompile.  It says that it's 
supposed to be a power of 2, but I'm not sure if that's really 
required.  You can set the value to something high like 1024.  I get 
around 300-350fps by doing this.  Some animations are a little bit 
messed up and the keyboard responses don't always work 100%, but it's 
still somewhat playable.

If you raise these values and it's still pegged at 60fps, then it could 
be your video card driver.

Cheers,

Daniel Hedlund

Subject: [Supertux-devel] SuperTux Configuration Files Contd. (patch)
Message-ID: <44A124F8.4080909@digitree.org>

I have taken my previous patch a bit further and changed when the 
configuration file was saved from when the program exits to when a user 
quits from the options menu.

Several advantages to this method include:
1.  changes to keyboard options get saved even if the game crashes while 
playing a level
2.  changes don't get saved if the program crashes while switching to or 
from fullscreen mode because they haven't explicitly exited the options 
menu.

Some things I had to change to make this possible:
1.  added an optional parameter to the Menu::update() function.  The 
definition now looks like:
const MenuAction &override_action = MENU_ACTION_NONE);
This allows us to now explicitly call a menu action from within the 
code, and not limit us to only user-supplied actions (ie. you can call 
"MENU_ACTION_BACK" after a couple minute timeout to return to the main 
menu).  I also had to make the MenuAction enumeration public for this to 
work.
2.  made the options menu back button an entry which executes it's 
menu_action() method , saves the configuration file and then tell the 
menu to go back to the title screen.

I have attached two patches, one patch, 
fix_config_options_save-2006-06-27, includes previous changes from my 
last email "SuperTux Configuration Files (patch)" using `svn diff`.  The 
other patch (options_save-2006-06-27) only includes changes since my 
last email using `diff -rU 3 src dst`.

Cheers,

Well of course you can do this, but the game won't be any better if you 
do so. You'll just burn CPU cycles and will possibily hit some 
inconsistencies that can happen because your timestep is now different. 
The human eye can't distinguish more than 50fps anyway AFAIK..

Greetings,

The only reason that Joseph wanted to raise the framerate beyond the 
60fps was to do some benchmarking.  Sometimes it's nice to know whether 
or not your computer's graphics card is barely managing to make 60fps, 
or whether it comes quite easily.  This is/could be important for some 
developers who have lower end systems to determine whether a level is 
going to be too big or busy for example.

Plus, if you have a CRT monitor, it's physically impossible to see a 
difference between values >= your monitor's refresh rate. If, e.g. your 
refresh rate is 75 Hz, there's no difference between 75 FPS and 300 FPS. 
(Go figure.)

I'm not sure about TFT/LCD monitors (since I don't have one), but I'm 
pretty sure there's a technical limitation there too.

The reason I care about the FPS at all is that... I'm BENCHMARKING! *gasp*
I'm testing to see whether Xubuntu 6.06 or Windows XP SP2 performs better
with an OpenGL-enabled graphics card (on the same system). I was going to
use ThinkTanks, another game I play, but there's kinda no Linux equivalent
of Fraps, and it won't work if I Wine it...

TFT/LCD monitors usually have a static refresh rate of 60 fps.  Some 
interesting information about frames per second in general:

Hello,
This level can be easily won by jumping onto the yeti and then following 
him right onto the ledge (staying on top of him). Is this supposed to be 
possible? It makes the level quite easy to pass.

Not in Milestone 1. The yeti is only there is the svn version. :-)

Are you able to bounce off the yeti onto the ledge? Or do you just
keep bouncing off him?

I think you should only be able to bounce off him once, then he should
go invincible for a second or two.

You can take out the icicles in the level file. And try it as a FireTux, you
might be able to shoot him and soften him up a bit.

Bug #7496, was updated on 2006-May-14 17:24
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: SuperTux
Category: None
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: trougnouf
Assigned to : none
Summary: error during the compilation of svn version

Details: sorry to try to use the developement version ^.^
i tryed to compil it (install all the dependeny, autogen and configure works) but during the compilation i got that

[...]
C++ ./build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/optimize/src/scripting/camera.o
C++ ./build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/optimize/src/scripting/time_scheduler.o
C++ ./build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/optimize/src/scripting/wrapper.o
LinkApplication actions too long (max 10240)!

thankyou this game is wonderful and it replace counter strike in every student's laptop of my school since i played it :D

Comment:
This problem is related to AMD64 processors and caused because the command line arguments supplied to jam's linker are too long for jam to handle.  A temporary workaround to this problem is to run the configure script with "--build=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu":
./configure --build=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu

This will shorten the list of arguments down by a few hundred characters, bringing you back under the 10240 limit.  Note that you should run "jam clean" before reconfiguring and rebuilding.

Yep, server trouble. The owner is a friend of mine. He told me that he
gets random freezes, it probably a hardware failure. It might take a few

I think I'm responsible for a bit of confusion. :-)
Rebecca, if you played only milestone 1 and didn't see a yeti, that's
okay because there wasn't one. You didn't miss anything. :-) However,
there was a level called "No more Mr Ice Guy" placed a few levels before
the castle. This level was supposed to contain a mini boss (hence the
title), while the final boss (the yeti) should be in the castle.
Unfortunately, neither of the bosses made it into the first milestone.
For milestone 2, we changed our plans a little: We dropped the mini
boss, and we placed the yeti in an extra level outside the castle. So
for milestone 2, I renamed the old "Ice Guy" level to "A Mysterious
House of Ice" and used the name "No more Mr Ice Guy" for the final boss
level.

New people are always very welcome. Don't hesitate to ask if you have 
any further questions about the code, it's also usually very helpfull to 
join the irc channel and ask the devs there directly.

Note that collision detection is probably 1 of the most complicated 
parts of the game. I'm currently rewriting the collision detection 
system which should fix the current issues if it works out, just wanted 
to tell you so we don't duplicate work.

I think the effect is okay, as it's not so easy to discover and not 
really reducing the fun of the game.

Comment:
A short hack in Jam sources fixes the problem: open jam.h and jump to line 461. Change the definition of MAXLINE to a larger number (try something like 30000), rebuild jam and copy the new binary into /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin or ~/bin (overwriting the one you've had before).

10240 is a pretty low limit, I give you that.

Comment:
This problem is related to AMD64 processors and caused because the command line arguments supplied to jam's linker are too long for jam to handle.  A temporary workaround to this problem is to run the configure script with "--build=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu":
./configure --build=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu

This will shorten the list of arguments down by a few hundred characters, bringing you back under the 10240 limit.  Note that you should run "jam clean" before reconfiguring and rebuilding.

Message-ID: <20060628193059.29577.qmail@server02.citromail.hu>



After I compiled flexlay, I started it with ./supertux-editor,
but all I got, is a confusing error:

/home/urmel/flexlaytrunk/supertux/../ruby/sexpr.rb:20:in `require': no such file to load -- stringio (LoadError)
        from /home/urmel/flexlaytrunk/supertux/../ruby/sexpr.rb:20
        from ./supertux.rb:47

As I understand, flexlay wants to load something, but what?

Subject: [Supertux-devel] Jam Fix for 10240-related Errors (patch)
Message-ID: <44A5830D.6050008@digitree.org>

I have made a patch that fixes the 10240-related errors when compiling 
with Jam (jam-fix-2006-06-30.patch).  The patch has only been tested 
under Linux at the moment and would be appreciated if anyone under 
Windows or OS X can let the list know if they have any problems.  
AnMaster also recommends for anyone with a multi-cpu/core system to see 
how well it works using multiple threads (ie. jam -j2).

This patch fixes the problem by breaking each of the SuperTux 
subdirectories into an archive file (.a) and then recombines them at the 
end to form the supertux executable.  This patch slows down overall 
compile time, but it should be compatible with most systems.

I have also attached an older patch (jam-fix-gcc4-2006-06-28.patch) I 
made that fixes the 10240 problems, but only appears to be compatible 
with GCC 4.x.  The part of the patch that is incompatible is the use of 
the '@file' syntax which looks in a file for a list of objects to link 
together.  This patch is much cleaner, but should not be introduced into 
the official source due to its incompatibilities.

Cheers,

Daniel Hedlund
