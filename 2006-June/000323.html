<PRE>I've been looking around at the user configuration file for SuperTux and 
have spotted a something that don't seem quite right to me.  Whenever a 
user passes a command-line argument to SuperTux, those command arguments 
are saved/reflected back in the SuperTux configuration file after 
SuperTux is run.

Some example scenarios where saving arguments is bad include:
1.  passing &quot;-f&quot; or &quot;--fullscreen&quot; to SuperTux.  If fullscreen mode is 
broken or gives a black screen, SuperTux would default to fullscreen 
mode the next time it is run without arguments.
2.  passing &quot;-g&quot; or &quot;--geometry ...&quot; to SuperTux.  Consider what happens 
if a really odd geometry gets passed to SuperTux such as &quot;600x800&quot;, 
&quot;1000x1&quot; or even &quot;1280x0&quot; (which causes SuperTux to crash but still save 
the geometry in the config); the user will be stuck with this weird 
resolution or crashes until they specify the original resolution on the 
command line (&quot;What was the original resolution?  Doh!&quot;).
3.  passing &quot;--show-fps&quot;,  &quot;--disable-sfx&quot; or &quot;--disable-music&quot; to 
SuperTux.  Frames per second will be shown in SuperTux forever until 
they manually edit the configuration file and disable it!  The 
configuration file is in lisp which makes things even worse from a 
user's point of view (&quot;(show_fps #t)&quot;).  Sound effects and music would 
also be permanently disabled until manually editing the config file.

My solution to this problem is to create two configuration objects, one 
representing the configuration file itself (&quot;config_file&quot;) and the other 
representing the configuration file with command arguments applied 
(&quot;config&quot;).  Whenever the configuration file is saved, it will save the 
version without the command arguments.

In addition, sometimes the configuration was saved each time an option 
was toggled (ex. fullscreen mode) and sometimes it wasn't (ex. 
configuring keyboard or joystick); the configuration file was always 
saved when the game quit though.  I have modified this behaviour to only 
save when the program quits to standardise behaviour.  This is temporary 
as I'm working on another patch that will save all command options when 
the options menu has been exited.  I should have this within a couple of 
hours.

The patch to prevent saving command arguments is attached.

Cheers,

Daniel Hedlund
