<PRE>I've been doing a bunch of work, checking out the various suggestions:

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I had great hopes for this patch, but found that something else is 
causing the slow frame rate, and the patch doesn't help that at all.  
The patch does help if one HAD to live with slow frame rates:  a) The 
velocities are more like those of 0.1.3 (although horribly jerkey at 
2.5fps).  b) It also seems to drop fewer keys.   (But I can't live with 
slow frame rates !^)

I thought for a minute that running SuperTux in a guest VMWare virtual 
machine might be causing the problem, so I installed it in the main 
(host) machine.  Then just to be sure, I uninstalled VMWare and 
rebooted.  All results were the same -- 0.3.0 ran at 2.5fps!

&gt;<i> SuperTux creates logfiles at the point where you start the

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>On some runs, I get the message in stderr.txt: &quot;Restarting audio source 
because of buffer underrun&quot;.  Other runs are clean.  Nothing ups the 
frame rate, even if I turn off sounds and music in the config file.

I installed Supertux-0.3.0-win32-setup.exe on an older 32-bit 800MHz 
Pentium III laptop running XP Pro SP2, with very similar results:

                                   Tower                 Laptop. A XXX
0.3.0:                         2.5fps                  1.2fps!  Abysmal.
0.1.3 w OpenGL:      ~10fps                 ~7fps
0.1.3 no OpenGL:     &gt;30fps                 &gt;30fps

(The tower is the machine I've been reporting on up to now.)  0.1.3 
seems to slow way down using OpenGL. 0.3.0 seems 4-6x slower than 
0.1.3.   (Rates are approximate using a stop watch on 50 frames, since 
the fps meter didn't seem to work.)

So it's looking like an OpenGL issue.  Which brings me to:

===== 4. The Digital Pioneer wrote:
&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> But seriously... I'll be trying 0.3.0 on windoze soon. I'll be 
</I>&gt;<i> downloading it presently, so I'll have more results soon. About all I 
</I>&gt;<i> can recommend is checking that your OGL is working properly (I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> see why it wouldn't be) and that nothing else is getting in Supertux's 
</I>&gt;<i> way.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>So I downloaded the latest driver from nVIDIA, which proports to have 
&quot;Microsoft&#174; DirectX&#174; 9.0c and OpenGL&#174; 2.0 support&quot;, from 
<A HREF="http://www.nvidia.com/object/winxp_2k_93.71.html">http://www.nvidia.com/object/winxp_2k_93.71.html</A> .  Still 2.5fps :-(

I'm presuming SuperTux is happy with OpenGL&#174; 2.0 support, but can't tell 
because supertux.berlios.de is down.

To figure out how to tune OpenGL, I googled opengl tuning and got an 
ati.amd.com/developer/gdc/Performance*Tuning*.pdf.   It suggested 
varying the frame buffer, and seeing its affect on fps, and I found that 
performance is frame buffer limited -- it renders about 1.5M Pixels Per 
Second (pps), actually it varies a little, 1.4-1.9 M pps:

800x600 -- 4fps            480,000      1.92M pps
400x300 -- 12.3fps       120,000      1.48M pps
300x225 -- 20fps            67,500      1.35M pps

===== 5. I'm guessin hardware acceleration is turned off, or something.  
Although display properties show hardware acceleration at full.  Now I'm 
not sure where to go from here.  Suggestions.
