<PRE>
   Supertux-0.3.0-win32-setup.exe running under Windows XP is so 
horribly laggy that it is unplayable.  Do other people have that 
experience, or am I doing something wrong?  I hope this group isn't 
ignoring the most popular OS in the world!  Even though I HATE Microsoft 
and XP, I would love to see a penguins take over windows boxes.  It 
would be a symbolic victory.  

   Sorry if I'm asking a perennial question, but I've seen only one 
reference to supertux being slow on www.supertux.info/forums, and 
manually searched back months on 
<A HREF="http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/supertux-devel">http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/supertux-devel</A> with no hits. (Will 
someone, PLEASE put a search all function on that site!)  Is there 
something I could do to improve the performance? A new OpenGL? New 
drivers.   I'd be happy to perform experiments if someone has a good 
idea of what and can make suggestions. I have some of my code in 
Supertux already.  If I get some help, I'll even write it up in the Wiki.

DETAILS:
   When I run supertux-0.1.3-setup.exe, I get totally acceptable 
performance.  But 0.3.0 has a 2 frames per second draw rate, and takes 
100% of the CPU (a 3000+ Athalon 64 with 1.5GB of RAM with NVIDIA 
GeForce3 Ti200 video).  Is there a major change between the versions, 
esp in their use of OpenGL, that slows down 0.3 over 0.1.3?  When I 
native compile the latest supertux from svn, the performance is equally 
poor. 

       Allen

P.S.: My personal motivation is that my grandson is a great Supertux 
player, but knows/has only XP.  At a precocious 5 years old, he's though 
of a couple ways to make the game &quot;better&quot;.  I want to make some of 
these changes for him, so he experiences what programming can do that.
