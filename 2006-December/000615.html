This is a problem in the code as far as I have understood. Morten
Hustveit wrote a patch fixing it - but I don't think it got into the
code-base before 0.3.0. His 4 core Xeon with an X1800 ATI-card got
truly horrible performance (due to the sleeping in-game). It looks as
if the better machine you got - the worse the performance gets
(because sleeping is extremely little precise, and a fast machine has
to do many, many sleeps in order to get a 60fps framerate instead of
3000 (as Morten's machine got)).

The patch also fixes some poor jumping-behaviour - and I really find
the game more enjoyable after applying it. The patch and email never
made it to the list. However, it should reside at

Since you suffer the same problem, I will paste Morten's email below:

Busy frameloop and jump patch
--

I tried out Supertux for the first time a few hours ago.  I immediately
noticed several annoying things:

 - There is a sleep in the mainloop
 - When doing small jumps, the animation looks odd
 - If you press the jump button immediately before landing, Tux won't jump

The sleep in the mainloop makes the framerate really unstable on some
machines.  I have a four core Xeon 2.66 GHz + Radeon X1900, and
experienced extremely varying framerates, sometimes below 30 fps.  You
should do what most OpenGL games do: busy loop.

I also had to change the framerate counter, since it showed an average
instead of the speed of the last frame.  If you do the latter instead,
it's easier to see when the framerate is unstable.  Additionally, I had to
add support for gettimeofday (when present), since I got framerates in
excess of 3000 fps (and SDL_GetTicks has only millisecond precision).

I also made a change to the controller code, so it counts how long each
key has been pressed.  This can be used for many gameplay related
features.  Another reason for modifying the mainloop was making this work
with high precision.

After changing the controller code, I could make the jump animation look
smooth, and make it much easier to jump immediately after hitting the
ground.  This is especially noticable when running and jumping on small
platforms.  (Without this patch, you are likely to fail to jump and just
run into the abyss).

The patch is attached.
