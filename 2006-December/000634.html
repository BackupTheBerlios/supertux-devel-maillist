<PRE>Hi,

I've been working on an universal binary of SuperTux 0.3.0 for Mac OS  
X.  I'm not sure if anyone has submitted one yet (and  
supertux.berlios.de doesn't seem to be responding for me at the  
moment), but if not, I now have a working binary available.  There  
are a few bugs (namely an SDL issue that creates a strange,  
fluorescent dock icon, and a limitation that forces the app bundle to  
be named SuperTux.app--if renamed the app won't run unless recompiled  
with a new path for the data directory coded in main.cpp) but they  
are minor IMHO.

The binary does need to be tested on a PowerPC platform (as I only  
have an Intel Mac now).  I am waiting to hear back from a friend that  
has an old G4 that I could have, but no response yet, so if anyone on  
the mailing list has a PowerPC Mac and would be willing to test,  
please let me know.  I can run the game in Rosetta, and it works  
fine, but the sound is garbled.  I'm hoping this is a Rosetta issue  
and the app will work fine on both architectures.  Let me know and I  
can send a copy of the binary to you somehow.

I don't have access to upload the file to Berlios.  Please let me  
know if (once it's been fully tested) it can be hosted on Berlios and  
how I could get access to upload it or how I should send it to  
someone who has access.

Also, please see the attached patch that fixes an issue with some old  
-DMACOSX code in main.cpp.  It used the variable msg_warning, which  
was not declared anywhere in it's scope.  I changed it to log_warning  
and it compiled fine, but probably should be fixed in the SVN version.

~Jayson
