You didn't give a lot of information before asking this question, so I 
can only assume you

  - downloaded SuperTux milestone 1 from the World Wide Web
  - heard about a new badguy
  - want to play with this badguy in milestone 1

I'm afraid that's not (easily) doable. SuperTux is currently not only in 
the process of being enhanced, but is also being partly rewritten. 
Several things are still missing, some others unstable and there's still 
a long way to go until the next release will be ready.

If you really want to experiment with the development version of 
SuperTux, a little bit of documentation on getting it is already in the 
Wiki at <http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Download/Subversion>.

I won't go into further detail without knowing what exactly you want, 
but feel free to

  - improve on the instructions in the Wiki
  - send back comments and suggestions to this list


Kind regards,

   Christoph

hello everyone.

Christoph,
Thanks for the zeekling link. I'm not sure if either attempt, yours or
mine,  makes the bad guy any more menacing for Tux. I like the way yours
fades her into the scene. We still need something more like zigzags or
divebombs.

Regarding the nogl patch. I have tried this on two low end machines where
ST-1.2 runs OK. (PII/PIII 450/700?, Nvidia something or another w/o
acceleration)  The nogl patch works, it just runs real slow. When I run
the nogl code on my more modern development workstation it runs OK. (AMD64
X.?)

enjoy.

No problem, this zeekling does divebombs:

Oh, and just ignore the junk in the diff file - looks like "jam clean" 
left some files behind. Just make sure to try it out on a backup ;-)

Thanks for the test drive! Yeah, I expected slow performance.

That's because the patch imitates its OpenGL counterpart as closely as 
possible (e.g. surface flipping done on-the-fly). Even with the best of 
tweaks, however, it could never run any smoother than the original, 
because it has to do without help from the GPU.

To me, it was more important to be able to play SuperTux on my 
onboard-graphics-only Linux box and on my virtual machines - they have 
more than enough power for SDL, but not nearly enough for Software-OpenGL.


Kind regards,

   Christoph

Message-ID: <4407703B.9000104@2006.expires.deltadevelopment.de>

Hi all,

I found an image for a badguy named "Angry Stone" in the trunk, but no 
sprites or code.

In the following patch I tried to bring this Angry Stone to life:
http://www.deltadevelopment.de/users/christoph/supertux/supertux-3063-angrystone.diff.gz

Graphics and code are still just a sketch - I'm just curious what you 
think about the idea.

Please note that the patch also replaces some enemies in world1/level1 
for easy testing and will generally wreak havok on your branch - so try 
it out on a backup.


Regards,

   Christoph

This looks good, Stephen just committed it and told me about it
(unforunately I didn't have time to look at it yet until now).

Some comments:
- If you create new files change the
	Copyright (C) 2005 Matthias Braun <matze at braunis.de>
to
	Copyright (C) 2006 Christoph Sommer <...>
It's your file and you should get the credit for it!
- you probably want to override the kill_fall() function with a function
that does nothing, so that angry stones don't kill themselfes and can't
be killed with fireballs

Anyway I like the patch and the badguy behaviour.

Greetings,
	Matze

I certainly agree that the Zeekling is too boring at this point.

I drew up a concept sketch of what I thought the Zeekling *could* do,
available here:


http://lingocomic.com/gfx/goodies/supertux/zeekling-drop-ideas.png

Other available colored eggs ideas:

purple: drops, creates a zeekling baby?  (maybe could act like the
goomba babies in mario 3)

green: one-up?

Unfortunately, with work and school taking up almost every minute of
my life right now, I don't have time to implement this myself...

Hey Stephanie,

SuperTux is undergoing constant development with the latest stable 
release being SuperTux "Milestone 1". This is what can be downloaded 
from the World Wide Web as binary packages.

SuperTux "Milestone 2" will be the next stable release. At this time 
there is no telling when it will be finished, but you can always try out 
the current (but unstable) development version by getting the sources 
via SVN and compiling them.

Kind regards,

Hallo Tanja, hallo Seline,

Schreibt also Fragen m?glichst auf Englisch, dann verstehen euch auch 
mehr Mitleser.

Der Hintergrund l?sst sich in den allgemeinen Level-Einstellungen 
?ndern. Klickt im Level-Editor dazu auf das "Werkzeug"-Symbol unten rechts.


> 2. Bei den Levels, die ihr hergestellt habt, hat es immer Anhaltspunkte. Wie
> kann ich diese setzen?

Falls ihr die Punkte meint, an denen Tux neu startet, falls er in einer 
Level stirbt: Diese Punkte lassen sich meines Wissens nach nicht mit dem 
integrierten Level-Editor ?ndern. Ihr k?nnt sie aber per Hand in die 
Level-Datei schreiben.

Legt dazu, wie z.B. in data/levels/world1/level1.stl zu sehen, eine 
Liste "reset-points" an. Um die Koordinaten zu bestimmen, k?nnt ihr z.B. 
einen Gegner an die gew?nschte Stelle setzen und seine Werte aus der 
Liste "objects" ?bernehmen.

Falls euch das zu aufwendig ist: Einige Leute haben auch alleinstehende 
Level-Editoren f?r SuperTux geschrieben. Vielleicht findet ihr ja einen, 
der euch gef?llt.


> 3. Bei euch hat es Levels, die "fahren". Wie kann ich dies machen?

Da bin ich zur Zeit ?berfragt. Ihr k?nnt aber auch hier einfach mal eine 
Level-Datei untersuchen, die so etwas macht und den entsprechenden 
Eintrag in eure Level-Datei ?bernehmen.


> 4. Gibt es schon Bonus Island 3? 

Meines Wissens nach noch nicht. Es gibt aber einige Level-Sammlungen im 
World Wide Web. <http://www.supertux.info> f?hrt zum Beispiel eine gro?e 
Auswahl von Levels, die von Fans erstellt wurden.

Hi,
As far as i know, the official answer for that question is "soon."
However, you could make "soon" become "sooner" if you contribute
something/anything to the project. check the wiki todo list. you don't need
to be a C++ or graphic/sound expert. writing the story and coming up with
new ideas would be great.

PS: you should be able to see the progress when items disappear from the
todo list, no items there anymore means there are just a few last tests
before the final release.

Hi,

I created a supertux worldmap-editor. With this editor you can open and save all supertux worldmaps (files with the extension .stwm) like the Bonus Islands I and II and the Icyisland-worldmap. It is also possible to create a new worldmap. The editor named SWafe can be downloaded from http://www.christian-hoff.de (on the startpage, click on the link named downloads(do not use the Supertux link!) and then click on the link to SWafe). I am sorry to say that the editor can't be run under linux because Mono does not support the .Net Framework in version 2 yet. Additionally you must download the .Net Framework 2.0 from Microsoft(23 Mb). If you don't, an error will occur when starting the application.

Please send your feedback to christian_hoff at gmx.net so that I know what has to be improved...

I hope you will have much fun with this editor!

Mono does support most of .net 2.0 by now (though I'm not sure how good
the System.Windows.Forms support is). Would be interesting to see the
sourcecode...

(You might also take a look at some stuff I tried here:
	http://www.stud.uni-karlsruhe.de/~uxsm/supertux-sharp.tar.bz2
it's just some experiments with C#, I ported some few parts of the
engine to it)

Mono does support most of .net 2.0 by now (though I'm not sure how good
the System.Windows.Forms support is). Would be interesting to see the
sourcecode...

(You might also take a look at some stuff I tried here:

it's just some experiments with C#, I ported some few parts of the

hello.

I took a stab at creating the strawbox listed in the wiki's todo.  There
is an animation for being hit with fire. These images need more work but
it's a start.

Since there is no working code yet for this feature here is a gif
animation so you can see it. I also dropped a non-animated object in
data/levels/world2/castledoor.stl.

There are no plans for this currently. There aren't that much new player
made levels that it would be worth putting them together to a new bonus
island.

Message-ID: <4422EAAA.2090701@gmx.net>

Hi,

I just downloaded and installed the supertux development version. At 
first everything works fine, but after I installed supertux, I cannot 
find any file to execute which would start the game. But the installed 
seems to have worked correctly (I can see the installation directory 
/usr/local/share/supertux with all images etc.). I did it exactly as 
described in the INSTALL-file. I also could not start supertux when 
typing "supertux" in the shell.

Does anyone know how to run supertux?

Greets,
Christian Hoff

You could try to run directly from the directory by browsing to it and
then executing it.

Let me know if that helps,

for me it just works if i write supertux -w (runs in window mode) from
anywhere in the terminal. there are some missing images as it seems, you'd
better copy the data folder to the installed data folder before running it
full screen

Hello Everybody,

The old into kinda annoyed me when tux got stuck, i changed title.cpp to use
the new scripted intro instead.

Special thanks to MatzeB, wansti and Devel__ for keeping up with my annoying
questions today. Hopefully i'll be able to contribute more to the project in
the future too.

Hey, I just wanted to leave a thank-you for producing an excellent free game.  (If it weren't free, we'd all have to pay for it! :)  SuperTux 1.3 is included with the SuSE 10.0 release, which is how I first learned of it.  Out of all the games SuSE puts on their releases, this is probably the most simply enjoyable one.  I think you've done a fantastic job producing a stable and playable game, and it's hilarious to boot.  Got to say, I love the sounds as well as the graphics.  
 
 One thing you could use (and I would help if I were able - still want to if I can find time during the summer) is some additional music. Five or six other soundtracks would spice up the background of the game.

Thank you for the positive feedback. On the music: don't worry. We're 
already working on the next release, which will contain quite a few 
pieces more music.

Hi Meaghan!

At the moment, Milestone 2 is only in production, so you'd have to 
install various development tools and compile (i.e. transfer it into an 
application file) yourself. If this does not put you down... no, you do 
not need to pay. Our development process is transparent and you can 
download the newest compilable production versions for free. However, as 
stated, these need to be compiled for you to be able to play them.

Dear Lucas,

There's only one realistic estimate: "When it's done." Not even we know 
when we'll complete it and since we don't want to create false hope 
(there's unfortunately more than enough of it in the world anyway), we 
are limiting ourselves to this simple sentence.

If you want to play new levels, have a look at 
<http://www.supertux.info/plmdlvlsres.php?title=&lvset=>. It's a list of 
levels made by other players on a SuperTux Fan Site.

While the quality of uploaded levels varies, you can find some real 
jewels in there.
