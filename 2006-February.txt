Hi there I am hoping you will be able to help me. Is there a key  on my key board I can use to get Tux over that tall wall It is a great game but there does not seem enough room for him to run and jump over that wall and I have tried just about everything. Please help. Sally

Hi!
Which level exactly are you talking about?

    Marek

P.S. For hints on gameplay, you can also check the forums at the
SuperTux Fansite (http://www.supertux.info). If someone had the same
problem, you might be able to find the answer there.

You need to use the "Run" key.  Hit escape, then go to configure your
keys.  You then can set up a run key.  You hold that key while running
the right to pick up speed and then you can jump the wall.

Hello everybody,
just though I could inform you about the new version of SuperTux PSP
Edition.

There were some issues with velocity not being properly adjusted, to
compensate for the tilesize change in the previous release.  This lead to a
few speedy objects.  Hopefully most of them should be adressed in this
update.

For a full changelist head over to:
http://jomarj.tihlde.org/projects/supertux

To the st-developers: you are doing an execellent job, keep it up!!

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards
Jomar Johansen

Hi all,

I've been working on a branch of SuperTux that completely removes the 
requirement for OpenGL - all rendering is now done with pure SDL.

I uploaded a patch for SuperTux SVN revision 3046 to
http://www.deltadevelopment.de/users/christoph/supertux/

As there seem to be quite a lot of SuperTux fans out there that are 
waiting to play SuperTux without OpenGL I hereby kindly request your 
permission to upload this branch to the official SuperTux repository.


Kind regards,

   Christoph

Hi Christoph,
thank you for your work on SuperTux.
The only problem I see is that we're planning to use a few OpenGL
functions (rotating, zooming, (colored) lightmaps, translucency) for
gameplay features, so simply disabling them is not an option.
Unfortunately, apart from a small lightmap test, we didn't implement any
of those features yet - the only big change we made to the graphics
engine since Milestone 1 was to throw out the non-opengl code. Unless
the things mentioned above can be done in SDL without slowing down the
game too much, it won't be any useful. :-/

Yes, I thought about the engine features advertised on the Wiki and 
talked about in the published meeting logs. Many of them - as you also 
concluded - will simply never be doable with SDL.

The reason why I created this patch anyway is simple: Without it, I and 
many others would just not be able to play SuperTux at all, so having to 
do without colored light and zooming cutscenes is a small price to pay 
for being able to play (no pun intended) :-)

Remember, we are talking about a code branch for non-GL systems, not a 
runtime-switch for software mode and surely not a new version of the 
SuperTux trunk.


Regards,

   Christoph

Reforcing what Christoph said, A full OpenGL version of supertux, will 
make many SuperTux players disapointed. At least here in Brasil, super 
tux is really famous among people who doesn't have a powerfull computer 
with OpenGL support.

It would be interesting, if those new effects, that would affect 
gameplay, could be changed for something similar (maybe not  as 
"beautiful" as the GL version) but that could "simulate" the same 
gameplay....

On most low-end computers OpenGL SuperTux will run *FAR* better then
non-OpenGL SuperTux and OpenGL is available on almost all computers
sold in the last half decade. Especially those computers that are fast
enough to run current software-2D SuperTux (fullscreen with 640x480
can eat a lots of CPU, thus requires a non-stoneage computer). Beside
some laptops which don't have OpenGL driver support, the PSP and the
GP2x I don't see much systems that could run a software-2D SuperTux,
but not a OpenGL SuperTux. If you know a bunch of widespread computers
that can't run OpenGL, but can do software-2D SuperTux fine I would
like to see some specs, CPU, graphics card and stuff.

Oh..there are many.

Intel Pentium 3 500Mhz
128MB SDRAM PC133
4mb AGP video Card
(with modified knoppix distro)
Non-openGL runs perfectly with 60 fps
OpenGL run with 10 ~ 15 fps

Celeron 400Mhz
96mb SDRAM PC100
(with gentoo)
Non-openGL runs perfectly with 60 fps
OpenGL run with 2 ~ 5 fps

I will see with some friends and some "digital inclusion centers"* here 
around... but it's easy.. most Pentium 3 and lower, with a standart 2D 
card will not work in OpenGL mode and will work fine without it...

* - I don't know how to say this exactly in english, but it's a place 
for poor people who don't even know what is computer learn about 
computers, and use them. Here in Brazil many of those places are powered 
by linux .. supertux is really famous among them.... :)

Could you try to find out the exact type of video card (first screen
when the PC is booting normally shows the type)?

I also kind of doubt the 60fps number, even my Athlon1800+ can just do
50fps in software and on a P3 600mhz I get around 25fps, so 60fps
seems out of reach for such kinds of hardware.

As far as I know there havn't been pure 2D cards around for a long
long time (maybe some on-board stuff?), basically everything has 3D,
some of course not supported by Linux, but mostly just exotic stuff.
Everything that is ATI, Nvidia or Matrox should run quite fine. Some
Intel and S3 stuff might be problematic.

Anyway, I started a SuperTux-portable branch in SVN a while ago, that
is however not a port, but a full rewrite from scratch aimed mainly at
the GBA at the moment and optimized for very low system requirements
(GBA only has 256kb of RAM), porting it to SDL should however be no
big issue (its far far from being playable, so it doesn't really
matter at the moment). The reason why it is a rewrite is because there
is little point in trying to make the latest SuperTux running
software, sure it can be done and the patch a few mails above shows
that its reasonably simple, it however neither supports all features
that Milestone2 will need nor does it provide enough performance to be
useable on low-spec systems (zooming, alphablending and such are very
slow in software).

Hi all,

I modified the well-known Spiky to create a variant that sits around on 
the floor sleeping. As soon as the player comes into sight, e.g. by 
passing him, he slowly gets to his feet and walks around.

Could be useful, e.g. by following the player into a pit or surprising 
the player from within a hidden cave.

Hey Connie.

Thanks for sending in your supportive email. It's nice to hear from people
who enjoyed the game so much that they dropped a line on the email list.

We working hard on the next milestone but unfortunately there is no
release date set yet. I can tell you that the project is still very active
and we will get you a new version as soon as possible.  (Sometimes I think
we're having to much fun playing the game and that's why we've been a
little slow on the next release :)

Take care,
Stephen Groundwater

Hey Christoph,

I wanted to say thanks for your recent postings. Looks like you may have
even put some newer bad guy ideas on your website today. I will be trying
out some of your stuff here when I get a few minutes. I really like the
idea of a bad guy that catches/spits Tux's fire shots back at him.

I encourage you hang out/around, stop into the IRC channel and keep
sending stuff into the list.

I understand wanting to put energy in to a non-GL branch/patch. I'd like
to possibly see that continued. But on the flip side, we made a decision
to break in favor of GL only. With talented people working together
towards the same goal we can achieve better results. People with non-GL
will still have the 1.3 release of SuperTux so it's not like we're taking
anything away.

Also of note, your patch/zip with the forest graphics is mostly work done
by our artistic lead, Ingo (Grumbel) Ruhnke.

Keep up the good work and I hope we catch you around on IRC.

Hey Christoph,

I wanted to say thanks for your recent postings. Looks like you may have

Yes, I fully understand and accept this decision.

I myself, however, have no choice: I run SuperTux SVN on either a Linux
box with onboard graphics or on a virtual machine. On both machines the
OpenGL version of SuperTux runs with only ~8fps, so I just /have/ to
create and maintain a -nogl Branch if I am to keep up with new versions,
try new features, maybe fix a bug, etc.

Subject: [Supertux-devel] Trouble with MrIceBlock
Message-ID: <43E9F6F1.5090309@2006.expires.deltadevelopment.de>

Hi all,

everytime I grabbed MrIceBlock, the game made a "kick" sound anyway.

Having player.cpp notify MrIceBlock immediately after grabbing him cured 
the problem for me.

This fix, however, depends on the Player receiving collision events 
before MrIceBlock. I do not know if this will always be the case in 
later versions of the game, so maybe sector.cpp would additionally have 
to make sure objects derived from Portable receive collision events 
after non-portable ones?

I do not yet fully understand the inner workings of the SuperTux engine, 
but anyway - it "worked for me" (tm), so I thought I post it.


Regards,

   Christoph

Hi all,

I found it hard to jump while running down a hill, so I made this little 
patch. Currently, it does not work with the level inverted, because I 
don't know if the tile collision normal vector being wrong in inverted 
levels is because of a bug or a feature.

What do you think?

(Responding very late to this... I don't check my email often enough
these days..)

By far this is the most interesting of all the renditions of Nolok you
have done so far.

I'd like to start working on a finalization of what Nolok will look
like, so I'm going to try to draw a bunch of intermediate forms
between the nolok ideas which have floated around, and we can decide
which one we want to stick with.

I'll post that up here soon.  Meanwhile I need to finish this
studying.

Thanks alot for this patch, I just commited it to svn. It fixes an
important showstopper for the milestone2 engine. And to be honest, I
wasn't sure yet how I could fix it cleanly, your patch does it in a nice
way.

Thanks alot for this patch, I just commited it to svn. It fixes an
important showstopper for the milestone2 engine. And to be honest, I
wasn't sure yet how I could fix it cleanly, your patch does it in a nice

Greetings,
	Matze

Subject: [Supertux-devel] found a little bug in milestone 1 0.1.3
Message-ID: <IUS7NQ$B1339A6B839A9627025B8E9AB2025D2E@laposte.net>

configuration:
*gentoo 2005.1
(http://packages.gentoo.org/search/?sstring=supertux)
*milwstone 1 ,version 0.1.3  

i have gentoo,and gentoo is well known for aplying a lot of
patch to the packages(it's a source distribution...)

but here it seems that there is no patch aplyed...
by the way emerge is the package management tool

so here is supertux package building in order to show that
there is no patch aplyed:

how to reproduce the bug:
*finish the main supertux game
*go to bonus level (i used bonus level II)
*play normaly and die 4 times
*now,normaly if you die you'll restart from the main menu...
*die and when tux is dying(jumping ) press esc
*click on abort level
*now you are on the "world menu" and the life count is as you
had 0 lifes
*choose a world and play...while loading it says that you have
-1 life

implications:
*if you have -1 life you can't restart from the middle of a
wolrd as when you have 1 life
*simply you don't return to the main menu...

by the way that's annoying to restart from the menu all the
time when your 4 lifes are oveer...mabe a option in the option
menu?

Hello.

Here are some links for a few things I've been working on.

This is a shot showing an electric (hotwater) tile set. It's similar to
the lava. Touch the blue static area and you get hurt. The blue firefly is
a moving platform.

Here is the zeekling with bright colors added.

I've done an animation set for the red/blue potions. Subtle bubbles done
in 4 frames.

we really like to play super tux.
but we have a problem.
We are making our own levels in the level editor,
but if we make 2 levels and then play the first in the bonus levels
it just goes back to the main screen if we finish level 1..
can you help us solve this weird problem?

Subject: [Supertux-devel] butt-slide-jump < bug or feature ?
Message-ID: <35422.192.168.1.1.1140830234.squirrel@gluebox.com>

hey ho.

The other day on IRC wantsi was trying to point out a specific bug/feature
where holding keys at the right moment causes tux to slide across the
screen on his butt. At least that's what I think we were supposed to see.

I think I just discovered what wantsi was trying to point out. I'm not
sure if it's a bug, seems more like  feature.

Here's how it works:

Tux runs down a sloped hill. While still moving down the slope he speeds
up in continued motion. Pressing the down arrow while in this motion and
still on the slope puts tux in a moving butt-jump position. When the slope
levels out tux continues to slide across the flat ground at run speed. He
continues until an object or upward slope is reached.

The fix that would make this a killer feature would be a jump at the end
of the run/slide. Either a ramp or a small upward slope/bump to send tux
flying. Using the ramp tux could do a butt-slide-jump that launches him to
a high location which is otherwise unreachable.

Here's a composite of screen shots showing my test yeti doing the
butt-side motions. This sprite is still in the works so yeti is missing
his arms :)

http://gluebox.com/images/yeti-butt-slide.jpg

At the moment using these key combinations is not possible with my arcade
iPAC joystick control panel, which is still under construction. It would
be worth it to me to have to rebuild my controller panel if someone were
to complete the code for the butt-slide-jump move. ( hint :)

Anyways, just food for thought.
enjoy

Message-ID: <20060227101344.GA13352@jonaskoelker.homeunix.org>

Hi.

I'm here to try to convince you to support software rendering for milestone 2.

So, why do I want that?  As Ingo wrote:

> Main reason for going OpenGL is that I want todo the same effects that
> my SNES could already do 15 years ago in 800x600 today, with software
> rendering thats impossible.

Well, my main reason for wanting you to still supporting software rendering is
that I want to do the same effects that my friend's SNES could already do 15
years ago in 800x600 today.  With OpenGL, that's impossible.

(Also, in Ingo's case, he used a pretty old computer--one can buy one's way
out of that problem, but AFAIK, one can't buy one's way out of not having
OpenGL--see below).

But before I go on, let me explain why it's impossible:  because I don't want
to use non-free software.

Again, I found the words of Ingo interesting:

> There are really only very very few cases left where people can't get

Okay... so which graphics cards have free(libre) (correct) drivers available,
and for which libre (dualbootable) OSes?  If there is any, please *please* let
me know--I've been dying to play the libre games that does require OpenGL.

I really love supertux, not the least because I can actually *play* it.
Please, *please* don't take the game away from me.

Kind regards,

Jonas K?lker

Hey Jonas,

Fear not, at the moment there is a patch which will allow you to build and
play the development version of ST without OpenGL.  (Thanks Christoph)

http://www.deltadevelopment.de/users/christoph/supertux/

There have not been a lot of GL effects added so the game still seems
playable with the patch. How much longer this will work remains to be seen
:)

I've been told that the free ATI Linux drivers work well with SuperTux
(tested with Milestone 1) in OpenGL mode.

Brand new shader capable OpenGL card costs 50EUR and yet even
something as old as a ATI Rage 128 should be enough for SuperTux.

Use a Matrox card or some of the ATI models, there you have your libre
OpenGL drivers. Nvidia TNT2 drivers might be libre as well, however
not sure about them. If you want more 'fun' you can render with Mesa,
won't be very fast, but if you lower the resolution a bit it might be
playable.

> Okay... so which graphics cards have free(libre) (correct) drivers
> available,

If you care about free(libre) drivers *BUY* a card that has them,
there are more then enough on the market, they might not be the most
powerfull cards, but for Supertux they are far more then enough. If
you haven't bought a card with free drivers, then hell stick to the
non-free ones, they work fine, they don't cost money and since you
bought that card in the first place its your fault.

> and for which libre (dualbootable) OSes? If there is any,
> please *please*

Those cases where there is no way to get accelerated OpenGL, ie.
laptops with unsupported chipsets, almost always come with a version
of Windows, no matter if you want or not. Sure its not libre, but if
you have already bought it you can use it. And again, if you don't
like that, you should have better choosen a piece of hardware that is
actually supported under Linux.

In the end there are more then enough cards with libre drivers on the
market, go buy one if libre drivers are important to you.

I like the idea of hard-to-spot fliers, but couldn't find a description 
of this behaviour on 
<http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Zeekling>. Could you 
elaborate on this concept?

Will the zeekling hide while far away from the players?
Or while having the players' backs turned towards her?
Or is there a completely different idea in the pipeline?


Btw: If the zeekling's hiding from the players is a willful decision 
made by her, just changing the opacity of the sprite seems a little dull 
to me. Maybe she could fade out tail first, eyes last or do some 
bubbly-style dissolving for extra eye-candy :)


Have a nice day,

   Christoph

In playing on my local build it seemed the zeekling was too boring, no
challenge. Since I can't code, the only way I could fix for myself was to
slowly fade the sprite in and out of an invisible state.

The animation fades in and out with a few extra empty frames during the
invisible state. Having to estimate where the bad guy is at certain points
seemed a little better than just having her go back and forth on the
screen.

A better fix would be some badguy logic code, like moving up and down
while flying or something. I'm not sure what the game plan is for the
zeekling's behavior.

I'm not suggesting this is a good thing, my animation set, that's why I
did not commit it to the repo. I'm just sharing my files back in case
people like.

Christoph, feel free to help make zeekling better. :)

Hmm, I'll see if I can give this a try.

This zeekling version decloaks only while above the player - eyes come 
first, rest slowly fades in.

Give it a shot, it's quite a thrill if you don't know where all the 
zeeklings are hiding.

Can you please tell me where SuperTux installs, and how to reset one of the
slots back to 'uplayed' status?

Thank you!

I don't want to meddle in this discussion again - just a quick note: 
Regardless of the core developers' decision against "wasting any time" 
on doing without OpenGL, I have created a -nogl patch that works pretty 
fine with SDL functions only.

<http://www.deltadevelopment.de/users/christoph/supertux/>

People seem to like it, too. The patch had quite an impressive amount of 
downloads lately, so I'll continue keeping the branch up-to-date with 
the trunk.


Kind regards,

   Christoph

Where can you find Milestone 2? Is it a new download or what? If you  
could respond with an answer, that would be appreciated.
Thanks.
