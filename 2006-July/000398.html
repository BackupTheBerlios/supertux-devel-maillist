<PRE>Hello SuperTux Crew.

We have gone back and forth over the last year with respect to making the
Tux sprite a single image again as opposed to the current four section
body parts. If anyone here on the ML was around when the split was made, -
feel free to shed light on why this split was a good idea or why this was
done.

In discussions on IRC I was commenting on how I would like to basically
zero out the head and feet and move towards a two sprite solution with a 
body and an arm sprites. From the graphic side this seems like the easiest
way to get some relief from the complexities of the current sectional Tux,
while still retaining a normal look as Tux's carried object gets layered
between the arms and the body.

IIRC, the other day Grumble had commented in favor of just a single Tux
sprite.  With additional single graphics for every situation.
i.e. - BigTux, BigTux with Block, FirehatTux, FirehatTux with Block, etc..

I started the process of making xcf templates for each 'singleTux'
situation but now I have questions about wether this is a good idea. The
problem I see is how natural things look and work, especially with regard
to holding an object and jumping through a 1 tile hole.

On IRC today I discussed this with Sommer and his comments were:
&quot;I don't know if one complete animation set per type of thing carried is a
good idea. I'd prefer a generic 'Tux carrying something' animation, which
the game can then overlay with e.g. MrIceblock. The game can then let Tux
carry MrIceblock closer to his body when he drops through a 1-tile-hole.&quot;

Please speak up if you have comments on how/why the Tux sprite should work.
I am leaning back towards my original game plan of body plus arm sprites.

- greetings :p
