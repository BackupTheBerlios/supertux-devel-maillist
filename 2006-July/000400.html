<PRE>There's been a &quot;bug&quot; in supertux since I've been using it for the past 6 
months related to the thread below.  The hot-spot of Tux, which (among 
other things) determines which brick he hits when he jumps upward, is in 
the upper LEFT-HAND corner of the Tux icon.  Much more reasonable would 
be for the hot spot to be in the upper CENTER.  Perhaps this can be 
fixed when these other changes are rolled in.

I have not energy to develop a patch, so will limit my involvement to 
being a critical bug finder !^)

Hello SuperTux Crew.

We have gone back and forth over the last year with respect to making the
Tux sprite a single image again as opposed to the current four section
body parts. If anyone here on the ML was around when the split was made, -
feel free to shed light on why this split was a good idea or why this was
done.

In discussions on IRC I was commenting on how I would like to basically
zero out the head and feet and move towards a two sprite solution with a 
body and an arm sprites. From the graphic side this seems like the easiest
way to get some relief from the complexities of the current sectional Tux,
while still retaining a normal look as Tux's carried object gets layered
between the arms and the body.

IIRC, the other day Grumble had commented in favor of just a single Tux
sprite.  With additional single graphics for every situation.
i.e. - BigTux, BigTux with Block, FirehatTux, FirehatTux with Block, etc..

I started the process of making xcf templates for each 'singleTux'
situation but now I have questions about wether this is a good idea. The
problem I see is how natural things look and work, especially with regard
to holding an object and jumping through a 1 tile hole.

On IRC today I discussed this with Sommer and his comments were:
&quot;I don't know if one complete animation set per type of thing carried is a
good idea. I'd prefer a generic 'Tux carrying something' animation, which
the game can then overlay with e.g. MrIceblock. The game can then let Tux
carry MrIceblock closer to his body when he drops through a 1-tile-hole.&quot;

Please speak up if you have comments on how/why the Tux sprite should work.
I am leaning back towards my original game plan of body plus arm sprites.

- greetings :p
