</I>&gt;<i> I just found out that the OSX linker doesn't know &quot;--whole-archive&quot;.

</I>Ondra, can you send me a copy of the man pages for g++ and ld so I can 
see if there is an alternative command argument I can use on that 
system?  It might be something simple.  Could you also provide me with 
the version numbers of OS X, g++ and ld?  For OS X users, it may be as 
simple as rolling back the new jam_fix patch and applying the other one 
I supplied in a previous email; the man page will help let me know if 
that's possible.

&gt;<i> Wouldn't it be easier just to modify a small value in the jam sources? 
</I>&gt;<i> While I think about it... we might want to drop a line to Perforce 
</I>&gt;<i> that they should use better ways of getting the number of max cmdline 
</I>&gt;<i> commands (and that 10240 is irrationally small).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Although there won't be that many different people compiling the 
SuperTux source code since there are a limited number of developers, you 
don't want to make it very difficult for an interested individual to 
dive into the project and start playing around.  There are probably 20 
people max who normally compile SuperTux and it's not a big thing to ask 
all the developers to modify the jam source code.  What is a big thing 
is to try to convince the Linux distributors/vendors to keep a patched 
version of jam specifically to compile SuperTux every time they want to 
distribute a binary package with their distribution.

&gt;<i> As an interim hack, search &quot;jam.h&quot; in your jam sources for &quot;Jam 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation misc&quot; and change the following definition of MAXLINE to 
</I>&gt;<i> a nicer number. (262144 on my Darwin box.) Run &quot;jam&quot; to compile itself 
</I>&gt;<i> (Baron M&#252;nchhausen's bootstrapping?) and overwrite your old binary 
</I>&gt;<i> with the resulting one.
</I>
Since we've committed the patch to SVN, this won't fix the problem 
anymore until we find another solution for your platform.  Can you or 
someone else with OS X please make yourselves known on the #supertux IRC 
channel so we can work this out as soon as possible.

Cheers,

Daniel Hedlund
