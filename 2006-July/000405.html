<PRE>This patch is essentially what I did to the objects in order to try to
improve scripting.  The scripting isn't mergeable because it has
crashing issues, so I tried to make a mergeable patch that only did my
changes to the object system with somewhat minimal changes to the
scripting system.

1.  Expanded portable interface to include a boolean &quot;portable&quot;, as
well as support methods and constructors.
2.  Expanded GameObject to include a std::string &quot;name&quot;, and added
support methods and constructors, notably one to allow the field to be
acquired from a level file.
3.  Expanded MovingObject to include a boolean &quot;solid&quot;, and added
support for what would become a scripting interface.
4.  Removed the &quot;flags&quot; field from GameObject, since it is pointless
with changes 1 and 3.  Fixed where things broke due to its removal.
5.  Made AmbientSound inherit from MovingObject instead of GameObject,
since most things that can actually exist physically in a level should
be MovingObjects, and I know how that class works.
6.  Loosened the singletoness of Camera, DisplayEffect, and Player.
Level doesn't have a host object, so I'm not sure how to handle that.
