<PRE>I always did like the score, especially trying to kill multiple badguys
before touching the ground, but it was a subjective score and playing the
level over again would raise my score significantly, so it really wasn't a
measure of how well I did in the level.  After playing the SVN of MS2 for a
while and not having score I am was really missing it.  However, the level
stats are just as good and more challenging.  It's a lot harder and more fun
to beat a best level time or capture all coins in a level and find all
hidden areas.  My only complaint was the 1up written on the small tux
powerup and the explanation of it in the phone/firefly/mask/bell/etc in the
first level.  Since they are changed as Arvid said, I would say the points
aren't necessary anymore.

just my 2 cents,
Jayson
