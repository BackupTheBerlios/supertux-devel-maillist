<PRE>A while back, I did some work to make Supertux have cross-platform 
repeatability of random numbers.  Back in the end of April, I released 
those changes, but the release did not go smoothly.  There were some 
bugs and others with SVN access made some stopgap fixes.  Since then, 
I've isolated the problem which probably prevented all of the changes 
from being incorporated.  Attached is a patch which should complete this 
task. 

I hope you can get it into SVN quickly, as I have put some time into 
reconstructing it.  Whoever puts it in, please let me know how it went.  
I am here to help with any problems which might come up.  However my 
time will be less available starting next month, and I probably won't be 
able to go through this exercise again.

It is based on a recent version (3821), and effects the following changes.

   1. The variable RAND_MAX is machine-dependent, and shouldn't be used
      inside the machine-independent RandomGenerator, as it currently
      is.  This patch fixes that problem, which expressed itself in
      Wintel platforms (where RAND_MAX=0x7fff and INT_MAX=0x7fffffff) as
      assertion failures as well as numeric errors in randf.
   2. In the current version, the random seed is not properly
      initialized from the demo file.  It says it does, but it doesn't.
      (Instead a random number is generated from time(0)).

    GOREY DETAILS:  For things to work, the call to init_rand() must be
    delayed until after the seed is read from the demo file. 
    Unfortunately just delaying the init_rand() call till after
    play_demo  caused the &quot;uninitialized random generator&quot; throw bug. To
    get around that problem, the code that reads the random seed was
    moved from GameSession :: play_demo method to a new method: 
    GameSession :: get_demo_random_seed, which could occur earlier. 
    Unfortunately in the process of doing that, play_demo stopped
    skipping over the initial seed, got confused, and prevented
    play_demo from operating at all. All of this should be fixed now.

Other lesser changes that are also in this patch are:

   1. RandomGenerator::rand(int) now has no fence-post biases. 
      Previously,  there were large biases in cases like when it's
      argument was, say, =rand_max*0.75.
   2. A debug mode was added to RandomGenerator, but set to OFF.
   3. A periodic call of rand had been added every 20 frames to aid in
      debug.  It was changed to call rand every cycle because the &quot;every
      20 times&quot; functionality broke due to other's changes.  The call is
      currently commented out, but I un-comment it for debug.
   4. The random_seed stored in the demo file is saved as decimal with
      leading spaces. This removes a trivial debugging cut-and-paste gotcha.
   5. in random_generator, an assertion check (of sizeof(int) &gt;= 4) was
      moved into initialization code to reduce processing time.
   6. An old commented-out erroneous call to srand(0) was removed totally.
