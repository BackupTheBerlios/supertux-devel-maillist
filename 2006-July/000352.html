</I>&gt;<i> Hey Daniel,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just found out that the OSX linker doesn't know &quot;--whole-archive&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wouldn't it be easier just to modify a small value in the jam sources? 
</I>&gt;<i> While I think about it... we might want to drop a line to Perforce 
</I>&gt;<i> that they should use better ways of getting the number of max cmdline 
</I>&gt;<i> commands (and that 10240 is irrationally small).
</I>
Unfortunately there are some problems with this:
* Jam isn't maintained actively, there are countless patches floating 
around the jam mailing list and in the perforce public repository (speed 
improvements, countless bugfixes to the builtin rules and even for 
commandline length if I remember correctly). The chance for a new jam 
release anytime soon is minimal :-(
* There are at least 2 forks of jam around at the moment: ftjam and 
boostjam. These are more actively maintained and we could look whether 
they already contain a fix for the commandline length issue or would 
include a patch from our side.
* Maybe the 10240 limit is there to enforce you to write portable 
jamfiles, there might be obscure platforms around that can't handle 
more. Then again these strange architectures are probably so old that we 
can't compile supertux on them anyway, so this point isn't really valid 
for us
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On OSX and other BSD systems, &quot;sysctl -n kern.argmax&quot; can be used to 
</I>&gt;<i> get the value.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As an interim hack, search &quot;jam.h&quot; in your jam sources for &quot;Jam 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation misc&quot; and change the following definition of MAXLINE to 
</I>&gt;<i> a nicer number. (262144 on my Darwin box.) Run &quot;jam&quot; to compile itself 
</I>&gt;<i> (Baron M&#252;nchhausen's bootstrapping?) and overwrite your old binary 
</I>&gt;<i> with the resulting one.
</I>Problem is that it's a very bad idea to ask our users to patch and 
compile their own jam binaries :-/

Greetings,
    Matze
