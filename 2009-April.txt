Subject: [Supertux-devel] SuperTux Wiki License switch from GFDL to CC-BY-SA
Message-ID: <4f45b570904132034n1a716068ocec7b4eac919644e@mail.gmail.com>

The GNU FDL 1.3 contains a section that allows conversion of Wiki
Content to CC-BY-SA without actually getting each and every authors
agreement:

http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3-faq.html
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/

Since there isn't really a reason to stick with GFDL I would suggest
we switch to CC-BY-SA, as it would mean one less license to worry
about.

Should be doable with some simple changes to the config file:

Reducing the number of licences is a good idea. Lets do it.
