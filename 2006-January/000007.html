<PRE>Hi there! I have the latest version of SuperTux for the PSP (PSP 
Edition). I have noticed a bug which you would probably want to fix. 
When you're at the map, choosing which level you want to go to, and you 
highlight some of the levels, the penguin brings you back a level. For 
example, when I bring my penguin to the dot of the level &quot;Tobgle Road&quot;, 
it brings it back to the level &quot;Via Nostalgica&quot;. Do you know if you can 
fix this bug (if it is a bug or if it's part of the game).  The only 
way for me to bypass it is to go to the level and quickly press X or 
quickly go to the next level. As a suggestion, do you know if you can 
make the snowball (the one that increases your size) move a little 
slower since it moves pretty fast. It's sometimes not enough time to 
actual react towards getting it since it's a surprise. Also, when 
you're invincible from the star, when you return back to normal, do you 
know if you could have some sort of warning, such as that song going 
faster so that you know that your invincibility is running out? Plus, 
when you have the ability to shoot the little snowballs (when you're 
red), do you know if you can make the snowballs travel a little slower 
and bounce less so that it would be easier to hit the opponent? It's 
kinda hard to hit them with the speed it's going and how much it 
bounces. Another thing would be the long load time it takes to go to 
the bonus section, but I guess that's part of the game. Other than 
those things, I think it's fine. Good game, hope you update it, and 
keep up the good work. I've been enjoying it so far! Please take this 
in consideration! Thanks for reading, and good luck in the future!
