<PRE>Hi!
The bugs you describe appear to be only in the PSP version, which was
not created by us. You should directly contact the author of the PSP
port you are using. The invincibility warning has already been
implemented and will be in the next (PC/Mac) version of the game.

&gt;<i> Hi there! I have the latest version of SuperTux for the PSP (PSP
</I>&gt;<i> Edition). I have noticed a bug which you would probably want to fix.
</I>&gt;<i> When you're at the map, choosing which level you want to go to, and
</I>&gt;<i> you highlight some of the levels, the penguin brings you back a level.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, when I bring my penguin to the dot of the level &quot;Tobgle
</I>&gt;<i> Road&quot;, it brings it back to the level &quot;Via Nostalgica&quot;. Do you know if
</I>&gt;<i> you can fix this bug (if it is a bug or if it's part of the game). 
</I>&gt;<i> The only way for me to bypass it is to go to the level and quickly
</I>&gt;<i> press X or quickly go to the next level. As a suggestion, do you know
</I>&gt;<i> if you can make the snowball (the one that increases your size) move a
</I>&gt;<i> little slower since it moves pretty fast. It's sometimes not enough
</I>&gt;<i> time to actual react towards getting it since it's a surprise. Also,
</I>&gt;<i> when you're invincible from the star, when you return back to normal,
</I>&gt;<i> do you know if you could have some sort of warning, such as that song
</I>&gt;<i> going faster so that you know that your invincibility is running out?
</I>&gt;<i> Plus, when you have the ability to shoot the little snowballs (when
</I>&gt;<i> you're red), do you know if you can make the snowballs travel a little
</I>&gt;<i> slower and bounce less so that it would be easier to hit the opponent?
</I>&gt;<i> It's kinda hard to hit them with the speed it's going and how much it
</I>&gt;<i> bounces. Another thing would be the long load time it takes to go to
</I>&gt;<i> the bonus section, but I guess that's part of the game. Other than
</I>&gt;<i> those things, I think it's fine. Good game, hope you update it, and
</I>&gt;<i> keep up the good work. I've been enjoying it so far! Please take this
</I>&gt;<i> in consideration! Thanks for reading, and good luck in the future!
