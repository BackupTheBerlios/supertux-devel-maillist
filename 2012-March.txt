parser.cpp cannot be found.

What may be the problem? The configure script found out the
dependencies successfully.

I have the revision 4408 from SVN (downloaded yesterday), and today I
have not been able to update. SVN tells me connection refused to
'svn.berlios.de'.

I could not get usefull information at Supertux Fansite either.

Thank you for any help, and congrats for the fine game!
