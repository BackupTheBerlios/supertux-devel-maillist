Subject: [Supertux-devel] Merge branches/supertux-milestone2-grumbel/ back
	to trunk/
Message-ID: <4f45b570911160922v7f3417dmc8ac159295635ee1@mail.gmail.com>

Are there any objections to merging
branches/supertux-milestone2-grumbel/ back into trunk/ or any
objections to the changes I have done? I don't trust svn much with
merging, so I would prefer to get the merge done before larger changes
happen to trunk/

Changes so far include:

* $Id$ tag removal
* switch to GPLv3
* indention fixes
* include optimizations
* some naming cleanup
* -ansi -pedantic -Wall cleanness
* some more use of auto_ptr, less use of raw pointers
* move of external libraries from src/ to external/
* sorting of files into subdirectories
* optional SCons build scripts (for the time being they are just
optional and don't replace CMake)
* other stuff, see "svn log" for details

Future work is documented in branches/supertux-milestone2-grumbel/TODO
